SPEAKER 0
The order of the people. So the permutation doesn't matter whether it's the first and the second person or the second or the first doesn't matter. So you have to divide because you have to count. You have to divide by the number of iterations. Does it make sense? Okay. Okay.

SPEAKER 1
Okay. So if you have a table where you like about the first time. The first time, like when you are writing, the fundamental.

SPEAKER 0
Will be a hold of you.

SPEAKER 1
No, that's okay. I think it's still got. We still got five minutes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Where? Oh. Okay. Okay. Should I just go to the one on one side? Yeah, we said so. What's it say? So when did you enrol? I in the beginning.

SPEAKER 0
So you knew?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. You need to reregister. Yeah. And I said that. Yeah. Oh, is that right? Yes. And now we're applying an element. Oh, yes. So?

SPEAKER 0
Because. So I think it's helpful to see. Yes.

SPEAKER 1
Yes.

SPEAKER 0
So this union. So this is A1 A2, the Union two by C6. But then when you think of this, the first thing you have to do is to see that.

SPEAKER 1
You kind of don't want to be playing at.

SPEAKER 0
This. Like it's sort of like imagine a function from 0 to 2 into an R, and you say, Well, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
I just come on x.

SPEAKER 0
Squared if X is.

SPEAKER 1
Chasing anyone who's.

SPEAKER 0
Not. So it's the same idea depending on where.

SPEAKER 1
You.

SPEAKER 0
Have a slightly different definition of what your function. So because you don't have to be in exactly one of them. Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
So you.

SPEAKER 0
Pick have you look at which what they would say it's not true and then you apply it.

SPEAKER 1
At least you know went around and then what we'll have to do is if if you're just going to go in that group, but then like are we allowed to make sure that the X don't have any X? Because I don't like it being a pat on the back. This is the definition I.

SPEAKER 0
So, I mean, I think what's confusing it is a fight in the elements. But the elements of the union, I mean, it's in the union, so it will have to begin because that is joined any element will belong to exactly one set. I think about this example. You know, maybe you can pick three of them. Yes. Yes.

SPEAKER 1
Nothing of yours in here, is there?

SPEAKER 0
No. You.

SPEAKER 1
Recently You.

SPEAKER 0
The union is the collection. So it's a set that contains all elements of each individual sector. So what is in the union has to do with this? One of the AI and anything that they look at is one of the AI is makes sense. So to make. One is a, B, and they see the E, The union is Abcd. And of course I'm mean bashful and this is just too. But you can.

SPEAKER 1
My two. It's.

SPEAKER 0
And you don't. It doesn't matter. It's just. It doesn't matter who comes first.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you. Thanks. Yes. There we go. It's probably. It was this use as well. This is a. We? Can't.

SPEAKER 2
So. Okay. Hello. Thanks for bearing with me there. Sorry about that slight delay in starting. Sorry, I should have gone through my slides. Quick recap of last week. You're all smart now. We'll learn about that iron triangle thing. We learned the importance of setting clear goals and having those clear goals was something we talked about in the seminars. Hopefully now your project specifications all have some really rock solid goals and they are motivated very well. Let's find out on Thursday. This session is being recorded. There is a live stream of this happening right now, so some people are joining us from home. Hello. Apologies that didn't work last week. That was an IT error. So we're now moving on to talking about project initiation. Now, this used to be my first lecture. Last week was kind of like a bonus lecture just for you guys, special edition. So this is really where projects tend to start initiation. You've probably heard of initiations. You've probably all joined many clubs and societies and had to do strange initiations with animals and things. That's that's not the kind of initiation we're doing today. We're doing the very boring kind of initiation that doesn't involve any animals at all. No animals will be harmed during this lecture. So today, first of all, we'll do a bit quick recap, just get you all woken up some wakey wakey work with a smart quiz and see if you remember how smart works. Then we're going to talk a bit about peer assessment. Usually I get lots of questions about that and I didn't get many last time, so I'm going to just remind you that you're going to be marking lots of essays this year. So I just want to sort of make sure you are clear about what the expectations are and we can get those details out of the way as early as possible. Then we're going to talk a bit more about that iron triangle thing, that thing that I didn't really quite understand last week, and hopefully I'll motivate to you why project management likes to talk about this iron triangle. I may not convince you of that, but what I'll hopefully convince you of is the big book called The PMBoK Guide, which is the Project Managers Bible. It's something you can all access via our reading list and something that I strongly urge you to dip into to get some good project management knowledge about different techniques and things. Then we'll talk about this project initiation thing, a few documents called a project mandate and a project charter or incredibly dull stuff, very similar to your project specifications, so it's probably a little bit relevant, so you might have to stay awake for that. And then finally, we'll talk about stakeholder management. So we're covering lots of different kind of introductory concepts here, hopefully that I'll try and keep it a bit interactive and a bit fun because I realise this is probably one of the more boring pieces of material you'll have to learn in this module. And I've got a lot of people to entertain today, so let's get started. So let's start with a quiz so everyone can log on to vbox. The link as usual, is worked at AC UK slash PM forces slash two this week. It was one last week it's two this week. You get the idea you need to come up with some kind of alias for yourself. You can use your real name if you want to. It's entirely up to you for the leaderboard for no other reason. I won't be tracking you down because of your hilarious comments during the Q&A section unless there are some particularly offensive ones, in which case I can track you down even if you use an alias. So don't try that. So let's start with the first question then. What a nice, easy one. What does a stand for in Smart? So if you were here last week, you should know that. Sorry. There's no there's no great music this week to keep us on our toes. Apologies for that. Okay. Okay. We've got 64 people logged on so far. Hopefully the rest of you can get logged on quickly and post an answer. These are obviously all useful things. For an objective to be assignable, you need to assign it to someone. It needs to be actionable. Very important that you can take action as a result of that objective needs to be something you can achieve. It needs to be appropriate. So these are all things that a smart objective should be. But what does the A stand for in Smart? Well, the answer is, of course. Achievable. So well done to the 98.55% of you. I think that's probably maybe 1 or 2 of you didn't get that right. But hopefully now you're all clear what the ace stands for. Excellent. What is the AR stand for in Smart? So. Again, these are all things that you should expect an objective to be. Okay. So let me stop the poll there. Everyone's got their answer in. You do need to I think sometimes. Sometimes have to press submit and sometimes don't just to get you used to vbox. Okay. So yeah, this one is a tricky one because if you google it, you'll get the wrong answer. Google uses the American version of Smart, which is not quite as smart as the British version of smart. So the answer is relevant. Okay. There's no point in having realistic as one of them because you've already got achievable, which is kind of encapsulating realism. You know, can this be done? Can this be achieved? So relevant is a better one, I think. Okay, so let's try some smart objectives. These. These are just some that I found online. You may or may not agree with my judgement here, but why is this one not a smart objective? So Alice will get a summer placement. So I can imagine if you're writing your career plans, many of you might be thinking about your your jobs after you finish here. You know, getting a summer placement might be on your list of objectives. Why is that not smart? Hopefully this was not too tricky, but once you put in your choices up to three, press submit. If you don't press submit, it doesn't count as entered. Okay. I'll give you a couple more seconds to get your votes in. Numbers are still going up a little bit. Okay, let's drop it there. So 65 of you have voted and these are what people think. So. Vast majority of you are saying it's not specific enough. Okay, that's fair enough. It's not specifying where the summer placements are going to be. Not measurable. Well, getting a summer placement is kind of a binary thing. You've either got one or you didn't. So it is measurable in that regard. You can measure it at the very end. It's not achievable. Well, most of you don't think it's not achievable? Well, it may not be achievable by some definition. It's not clear if it's achievable. So there's nothing clear in that statement that it is achievable. You probably need some more context to know if that was achievable. It's not relevant. Not relevant. She's done a four year module for your course. You didn't need a summer placement. She's on a three year course. She should have a job, maybe, I don't know. Not time bound. Certainly not. So. Certainly it's not time bound. But what I've gone for and not specific. Yeah. You might want to be more specific about which summer placements you want. So I think maybe half a mark for that, although it's not encoded in the VOC, so you won't get any points. But I agree that it's not measurable, It's not measurable because it's not. It's not something that you can measure as as an aid to make progress. So one of the important things about objectives is that you can measure not just that they have have been ultimately achieved. All of that is incredibly important, but also something that can help you make progress towards achieving it. So something more measurable, perhaps on a more immediate timescale would have been better. So the suggestion I've got at the bottom there is Alice will apply to three places of summer employment, so there's a very measurable amount of work she has to do and it's not dependent on some external factor to gauge whether or not it's been succeeded or not. The work will be measurable almost straightaway once she does it. So again, the achievability, well, we don't know if she'll actually get the summer placement right. We don't know how good she is. So maybe applying is a better thing because you can tick that off a list. You can achieve that very much more readily. And again, the time bound here, She's going to keep doing this every every month for six months. So do you see how this is? You know, maybe the ticks are wrong. Maybe you can argue a case for each of those. I'd allow you to do that and examine and perhaps there would be credit for any given one of these things. These are the ones that I happen to pick. There's no necessarily a right or wrong answer, which doesn't make it smart, but hopefully you can all appreciate why this is much smarter and why it's something that and hopefully that's something that in an exam situation you'd be able to come up with a smarter version of the objective. Okay. All right. Let's have another one of these then. So Bob will do research into potential sorting algorithms in week two. He sounds like a typical. Third year project for Bob. So you can vote for up to two here. What is this not good at? Why is this not smart? Okay. Don't forget to press submit at the bottom once you've picked your two. Okay. I'll give you a few more seconds there. The numbers are still going up. And then was going down now or back up again. All right. There we go. I'll stop the poll there because we've got quite a lot of votes in. Good. So what is wrong with this one? Well, it seems like the majority of the class. You think not specific enough, maybe not specific as to which sorting algorithms the research will be done into. There are many sorting algorithms, so maybe a bit more specificity there will be useful. Not measurable. It's not measurable in the sense that maybe the number of sorting algorithms isn't specified. So I think well done. You get that right. A good example at the bottom here would be Bob will test the performance of QuickSort and merge, sort on the target data set in week two. Much more specific something that you can really genuinely measure, make progress towards very clear what's trying to be achieved there. I know with a lot of third year project objectives, you're not clear yourself what you're going to do yet, which is why your objectives can be quite vague. That's why it's really important to try and get some of that initial high level research done at an early stage so that you can be a bit more specific, even if it's specificity. To the extent that I'm going to explore these possible algorithms, which I don't know anything about, but I Googled it and they seemed like the obvious choices, you know, that is better than just saying leaving it fully open ended. It's important to try and try and, you know, define what you're going to try to do. Okay. And let's have the final smart, objective question. Charlie will review the literature on compiler optimisation in turn. Want to ensure complete knowledge of the subject? So I see a lot of these kinds of objectives in third year specifications. Project specifications. Why is it not smart enough? And they're up to three choices for this one.

SPEAKER 3
Okay.

SPEAKER 2
Don't forget to suppress. Submit. Numbers are going up fast. Now, this is good. When it gets to maybe 70, I'll stop it. Okay, I'll stop it there. The numbers are going down now. We've got 71. Excellent. Okay. Oh, nice spread here. So we're going for this? Not specific enough. Yeah. Maybe anyone who knows anything about compiler optimisation knows that there is a lot of research to read. Maybe it's. It's not specific enough. Not measurable. For measuring complete knowledge of a subject is probably not the case. You probably can't measure it, so I think that seems fair enough. Not achievable yet. It seems a bit unrealistic. So the answers I've gone for are actually achievable, relevant, not achievable, relevant or time bound. So I think it's not relevant to read the entire body of literature on compiler optimisation. For any project, you need to know a specific knowledge about specific things. You don't need to know the entire body of knowledge. You don't need complete knowledge of the subject. So I've said it's not really relevant. I've also said it's not time bound because I don't think it's time bound enough. By the end of term, one seems far too far into the future. I'd much rather a more specific objective over a shorter timescale than a really long big one like that, which it feels to me like that could just take a nebulous amount of time. It could just it could just never get done. It seems like the kind of objective that someone never actually does until they finally come to writing their dissertation and then realise they really did need that research and that knowledge. So yeah, I've said not achievable, relevant or time bound. A better example might be Charlie will research compiler optimisation and identify three candidates for the project by week three. Something much more specific, much more goal oriented. Remember in the seminar last week we talked about those those goals of the project, what you want to achieve at the end. Does having complete knowledge of compiler optimisation get you to that end goal or does it actually give you so much redundant knowledge that you didn't need? I think I think probably the latter. Okay. So yeah, that was perhaps a little bit ambiguous and maybe there's more than one answer. I would acknowledge that. But here is the leaderboard so far. See if you can support yourself on there. Usually I'm usually I'm on there, but I'm not on there this year. No one's trying to masquerade as me. Surprised. Okay. So now we're all woken up. Let's do a bit of Boring housekeeping and talk a bit about group work and peer assessment. So come Thursday you will be in groups doing seminar work. You will be working on your case study projects for the rest of the term. So it's very important that you all attend in your correct allocated seminar group on Thursday. So this is where we are thus far. We are at that point there, the yellow, the big yellow line. So we're talking about project initiation today. We're going to do a project selection process where you're going to pick the case study and you're going to have to pitch it to the rest of the class while your team should win your chosen project. So that's not an assessed piece of work, but it does give you some practice at presenting in front of the class, which is something you will be assessed at the end of term. So before we go any further, I know that I know of one existing seminar issue, so please do tell me if you have any seminar issues. If if the number is, Oh, there we go. If the number is more than one, then then I'll know that there's more more issues to deal with.

UNKNOWN
There's a bit of sand. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
I'll wait a little bit longer, just in case. One of the issues is the inability to get under vbox. So please do post if no issues as well. Just so I know for sure, press submit at the end as well. With these multiple choice ones, you have to submit your choices for some reason. Okay, there are 78 view logged on, so hopefully some of you left the room. Shall I stop it there? I guess I'll stop it there. Oh, another one. Is anyone. Anyone desperately trying to press submit and failing? Okay, I'm going to stop it there. The last four of you. Maybe you're just. You wanted to abstain from the vote. Fair enough. So that's good. Most people, no issues. Two are not. Not enrolled. Those who aren't enrolled. You do need to enrol. If you don't enrol, you won't be allocated to a group. It'll mess everything up in terms of the allocation. So do enrol. If you if you plan to stick, stick at it with this module. Given the late notice, if you haven't enrolled you need you'll need to contact UD support of course, and make sure you get allocated to a seminar slot or let me know as well just so that we can make sure something happens. Seven of you not assigned to a seminar. A seminar yet? That's a problem. We need to get you to a seminar again. Can you email me and support? I'll try and make sure that happens by Thursday because we need you allocated to a seminar so we can balance the groups out. It's not really easy to change groups after after that first seminar, the two of you with a timetable clash, please also contact CSU support and ask to be switched to a different seminar group because I'm hoping that by Thursday everyone's in the correct group and everything will go smoothly and we don't need to do any swaps or anything afterwards. Otherwise that can get a bit rubbish. If some teams lose members once they've already started the work. Okay. So is everyone clear what action needs to be taken as a result of that? Those those 64 of you with no issues. Congratulations. Just come to your allocated slot. Don't come to a different one please. On Thursday. Okay, so the assignment for this module, one of the assignments is an essay. You'll be submitting that essay at the end, but you're also submitting an interim version of that essay. So half of that work will be submitted in week seven. Um. Now, what we won't be doing is peer evaluation. That was. That's been cancelled. So I'll just change that. Did an excellent job. Reduce your workload considerably. I'm sorry. I've got a question there. Let me just. There we go. I don't think I need to answer that one. Okay. So you're not doing peer evaluation, but you are. You are still required to attend seminars. Your team-mates need you to take part there. However, if you don't pull your weight on your team, you won't be penalised for that. You will just bring your team performance down. You'll just let your team-mates down. That should be an incentive enough to make sure you do attend and participate. I'm peer assessment is the act of assessing the essays written by peers. So, for example, if you submit your assignment, five of your colleagues, your peers, the people sitting around you will be marking that piece of work. And likewise you will be marking five random people's work from around this class. Um. This is something that students often think is a lot of extra work, but it is scientifically proven to be incredibly valuable for your understanding of material, for your critical thinking skills, and for the ability to judge other people's work and projects. As a project manager, you quite often get thrown in the deep end given a project and you have to decide what to do. Making those critical decisions is a really important part of project management and it's an important part therefore to assess and that's why we do peer assessment. So is the peer assessment for credit Well. It's sort of a credit in that if you don't do it, you will be penalised and the grades that you give will affect your peers, but it doesn't directly you aren't directly judged on the quality of your feedback. What we do do is check that the feedback that you give is good enough. If it meets that threshold, then you won't be penalised. If it falls below that threshold, then you will be penalised for not trying hard enough and giving good feedback. So the quality of feedback only needs to be good enough. You don't need to be writing long essays of feedback. You don't need to be pinpoint accurate at judging how many marks to give something. You try your best justify your decisions. That's satisfactory. The rest we can we can correct and make more robust using various algorithms. So yeah, that's the goal of pure assessment is to make you aware of how to judge other people's work, but not to sort of judge you for your judgement of other people, because that just gets a little bit too meta and it's a bit yeah, messes with your mind. Does that make it clear? Sorry, the, the slides are a bit out of date unfortunately. So apologies for changing live in the session. So let me talk a bit about assessment why we do it. I want to motivate this because I think it is really important that you embrace this idea and really take it on whole heartedly. Now, this is this is a normal situation. There's you you've wrote a great essay, five lines long. You've worked really hard on this one. You didn't even use ChatGPT this time. So, you know, fantastic work. And then this is what happens, right? You are one amongst hundreds of people's work that the tutor has to assess. That doesn't make you happy because how much time can that due to genuinely give to your piece of work they probably won't want appreciate the fact that you made it rhyme or you added these great diagrams with nice colours. They're not going to appreciate that because they're going to skim read it. It's just inevitable and you just can't mark that many very similar documents without becoming a bit of a robot yourself and actually not being able to pay attention to what you're doing. So this is not an efficient way of marking stuff. Human beings weren't made to be computational machines like this. The teachers are happy. You're and happy. And look. Blood spatter everywhere. That's kind of how it feels when you have to mark this many essays. All right. A much more sensible situation is if everyone does a small amount of that work. If you crowdsource that work, everyone pays a lot more attention to the work that they're reading. They're learning something while they do it. They don't get overwhelmed and saturated with that information. They get just enough knowledge that it can actually benefit them with their own work. That's the beauty of peer marketing and it's so much quicker. This takes a week to turn around five essays as opposed to 20 working days, plus or minus all the rest of the mess. Right? So everyone benefits. You benefit through the knowledge transfer. The idea that you read someone else's essay and you can steal their great ideas and do that in your own essay. And I'm not talking plagiarism, but the idea that you can learn something from someone else's ideas. So you learn through the essays and you learn through the giving of feedback and the receiving of feedback. Sometimes the feedback you get from your peers would be pretty rubbish. Other times it might be actually useful. So you will get some nuggets of knowledge from different perspectives which you wouldn't normally get. The most important thing, according to the scientific literature, is that it develops a thing called assessment literacy. What it means is you understand what is being asked of you. You learn what is happened there. PowerPoint craft. Wow. Too much blood splatter on my slides, I guess. Very strange. Well, we can do some questions while we wait for PowerPoint to start up again. Will you get extra marks if you turn up in a maid outfit? Sadly not. Um. No. Are there any sensible questions in here? It's probably worth having a few sensible ones in. Yes, I did manually draw the arrows penalised yet. That's good. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So I think I've answered all the questions. At least that's the main thing. Let's get back to her. The sensible things I do. Yeah. Too much time answering your questions. Not enough time marking. I think that's the. That's the conclusion. Okay. Okay. I'm already connected. Apologies. It's. Okay. I hope that doesn't mess up the leaderboards. Apologies to those of you who were topping that leaderboard, if it has. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to go through the blood spatter. It's going to crash the slide. Oh. Now. I wrote a script to make the arrows for those who were curious. There we go. Okay, so assessment literacy, this idea that you're learning what's expected of you that makes you really good at doing your own essays and actually notably improves the marks you get on your own essays when you know what the assessment criteria are. I know we published the assessment criteria for every essay, but no one actually reads those things, right? But if you actually have to mark some stuff, you have no choice but to read it. I think that's why it makes you better at stuff. Obviously, those critical in evaluation skills, things that are very important for project managers seeing and appreciating and evaluating different perspectives, active learning. You're actually engaging by reading other people's work. You learn more that way. It's actually fairer, more accurate and unbiased. Now, this is a thing where students often think it's opposite, right? They think a tutor is more unbiased. They've obviously not met many of the tutors. One human being is very biased. Human beings are very rubbish at making objective judgement. But if you crowdsource, if you average that out across different people, you're able to very accurately gauge where the bias exists and then you're able to correct for that bias and therefore have much more robust outcomes. So crowdsourcing is a much more effective way of achieving fairness. And actually I have shown in this module that it improves the learning outcome. So when I introduced peer assessment, even after scaling and moderation, it improved the quality of the final essays by about 15%. So that's what you gained by having an interim submission where you've got to learn from each other's experiences and and copy each other's ideas and produce better essays at the end. So that's how it is now. We've already did a brief bit of questions there, but are there any questions specifically about peer assessment? Can we see examples of marked essays? Yes, you can. That's the whole point of peer assessment. You get to see examples of other people's essays not marked except until you mark them, and then you're seeing examples of marked essays. So yes, you do after you've marked them. Hopefully that answers the question. I know it doesn't answer the question. I think that's something you'd like to see. I will. I'll talk through a worked example. But what I don't want to do is bias your judgement towards certain types of essays. I think the whole point of peer assessment is you're giving your fresh eyes and fresh perspective on every essay. You see your unique personal perspective on that essay. You'll be judging it in ways that you see as appropriate. So I think the crowdsource solution is better than me giving you a moral way of marking. I will give you a mark scheme and explain how to use it. Of course. We already had a question last week. No, you can't. Yeah. Yeah. And I will use that time to better effect, to better teach you guys. Okay. So I think we've gone through the questions that are relevant there. So let's talk about some project management stuff now. We're going to talk about the iron triangle and I want to try and debunk this project Management 101 thing that comes from all the business school courses. So this is the big slab of metal I showed you last week and I said, This is the tool used by most project managers. It's hard to make sense of this. You've got to try and maybe think a bit abstract. One way of thinking of it is this is a very rigid thing. But then of course, cost isn't rigid, right? You can choose how much you cost, you spend on something. You can choose how much time you spend on something. So it's not that it's rigid in the sense that it doesn't move, but if you were to move the cost, it would change the time it would take or it would adjust the scope, right? So I guess what it's trying to tell you is there's a constraint here, a constraint that you can't really avoid where these things are linked. So that's what it means by the triangle being rigid. And another way of drawing this is to draw it like this with a big quality word written in the middle. And what that's telling us is that the quality of the project is constrained by things like the time, the cost and the scope. Now, I don't know how useful that is. I mean, it's probably obvious. And I think it might be worth just sort of. Well, let's I'll explain to it to explain it to you the way it's explained to project management. And I'll explain to you it in a way that I think is better. First of all, what is scope? Well, hopefully, you know what scope is. We talked about it in the seminar last week. Scope is the things that you are building. It's the things that you're making. The scope is how much you make of the project. Compare that to quality. Quality is how good the features are, you know, the properties of those features. So the scope is how many features and the quality is the properties of those features, such as how good they are, the quality that they're produced with. Okay, so people like to draw a little star or something within the iron triangle to say, well, the customer's priorities are at this end of the iron triangle. This customer is prioritising time. And obviously this this person is maybe trading off time and scope. They think time is important and scope is important, but they're not bothered about cost. I don't really understand the geometry of this triangle to make any sense of what it means. If you move into the middle, maybe it means you prioritise all three. I don't know how that helps you make any decisions. I think what we should do is start again and what we should do is draw a Venn diagram, because I think that's more of a computer scientist or mathematical approach. Now what you can have is you can have a project that's done really fast or you can have a project with all the features that you would could ever imagine. We call it a broad scope, or you can have a really cheap project. You just do it really cheap, minimum viable thing. Just, you know, no frills. Super simple, right? What you can't have is all three of these things. In the middle there. I'll just zoom in for those of you who can't see. That's that's not going to happen, Right? You're not going to have it really fast, really cheap and doing everything you want it to do, that's just infeasible. You always having to make a compromise. And that to me is the point of the iron triangle that need to find a balance, the trade off between different things. Okay. So you can think of it another way, another computer science approach. Think of it as a sort of a constraint satisfaction problem, right? You've got a cost. The cost can't be in this area, right? The lowest price it could possibly be is this line. This area is just like out of bounds. Okay? And then, look, there's time. It can't be any quicker than this. So this is kind of the shortest duration. And there's scope, right? You can't have any more features than all of them. So that's kind of the the upper bound for scope. Okay. So you can then kind of sort of add axes to this, right? So this is this is the scope axis. This is the cost axis, this is the time axis. And because this is kind of three dimensions on a two dimensional surface, you can't have all of these three things at once. It's the same, the same conclusion. So what does it mean now to be on this triangle in different positions? Well, obviously, if you're in the bottom right corner, you can have something really good, has all the features you want and really cheap if you're prepared to outsource it to a faraway country where it costs very little to manufacture, but you can't get it soon, You have to wait a long, long time for that to be delivered. Or you can have some really simple, basic version of a product, something that has very few features, but it's cheap and you can have it right now, or you can have some fully featured version. You can have it on time, no pun by meant by being watch, but it's expensive if you want it to be fully featured on time. So I think it's pretty obvious what the corners of that triangle mean. You can also imagine what the gaps in between mean. For example, your third year project. Perhaps it has to be low cost because you're all very poor and you can't afford to pay for some cloud computing, it turns out. But you might want to trade off. How much time are you going to spend? Some people want to spend a lot of time in their project. And have a lot of time here. They want all the features, but they're going to struggle to get everything done in the time available. They might even end up being late at completing their minimum viable product. Some people want to have really simple version of their product, get it delivered very quickly, hand that in and have a really great term. Two and have like a really great party at Easter or something. You can decide yourself, How are you going to trade this off? You are the customer in your third year project. You can make that trade off. Likewise, you can choose on this axis. Now we're going to move this direction. You can choose to go for a really cheap product with very few features, maybe not as much baking involved, and then you can go for the really premium product. You pay a lot more money for it, but they might actually cook the beans. You can choose yourself if you want to pay a lot of money to get the features or not. Time is not really in that equation. And likewise, think about waterfall. Waterfall is a way of achieving. You have to make that trade off between are you going to do a really big project? Do you want to spend a lot of money or do you want a really small project? You can kind of make those kinds of decisions, but you want all the features. If you're using Waterfall, you specify those features upfront. So you can see that in different ways. You can make trade offs, but you usually have to fix something. You make one thing fixed, such as the scope or the budget, and then you trade off the others, depending on your personal preferences. What does it mean to be in the middle of that triangle? Well, it probably means that you're compromising on everything. Think about high speed two. It might be late, expensive, and not have any of the initial intended scope to the point where it fails to meet its initial objectives. You might think it's sensible to cancel the project or not. Well, we might discuss that in week five when we talk about budgeting and Rishi Sunak. Okay. So the iron triangle, that's what it is. That's how it's presented in the project management literature. But I urge you to think of it in a more critical way. It is actually quite useful device when you start to break it down to understand the different components. Now, of course we can go beyond those simple dimensions. We can add a cost, we can certainly we can add a quality dimension. Quality is this fluid concept that can actually you can have a high quality or a medium quality or a low quality version. So that's also a dimension that we might want to trade off. We might want a really low quality version to save money, or we might realise that a high quality version will save us money in the long run. So there are different ways that these variables are linked. If we add an extra dimension now, I should, I should say this is an invention of mine. This is not something from a textbook. There is no such thing as the titanium tetrahedron. So when you go to your your prints two exam or whatever it is when you're doing your MBA, don't start quoting the titanium tetrahedron. They won't know what you're talking about. This is the hard hexagram apparently just made it up. What I've added to this one is things like risk and resources. So the management of people, the management of risks, these are things that you can also choose. You can choose to take massive risks to save money. Cut corners. Let's not bother with the compliance, you know, let's just. Instead of building this software, well, let's burgle it from someone, Right? You can take huge risks to make cost savings or time savings. I'm not advising that. But sometimes there are opportunities that you can take, and therefore, that also needs to be factored into the trade off. So these are more constraints and in fact, we can keep on going. This is my difficult dodecahedron, although I think it's actually a decade gone. Is it? I don't know. In this example, what I've added is 12 different areas, 12, no, ten, ten, ten different areas which I think are important constraints to consider in any project. And I got these ten things from a big textbook called the Project Management Body of Knowledge. These are the project management knowledge areas. So we've got the obvious ones, the usual constraints like scope, time, cost and quality. Then we've got the ones, things like risk, which can also be considered something that you trade off and manage. Then these four here are sort of people related things, things like managing resources, managing procurement, managing different stakeholders and managing communication. So I guess communication related things where you need to make certain decisions and you can even add a knowledge area here called integration. That's where you do the work of linking all these things together. So the reason I've sort of segue into this is that there are more than just three parts of a project to manage. And according to the project management Body of Knowledge, there are ten that you need to manage on every single project you do. We're going to come and talk about that in a moment. We might have a little break. But in summary then for this first section, management is fundamentally about making trade offs, compromises. You can't have everything. So you therefore have to make some difficult decisions. And as a project manager, you are constantly facing situations where you have to make those difficult kinds of decisions. The decision you make will not just be based on your experience or gut instinct, but also on the customer's priorities and where they sit within that iron triangle. And there are more than just three standard constraints. There are many more, and those could be expressed as a dodecahedron of ten knowledge areas that need to be managed. Okay. So let us take a pause there before we get into the really boring stuff. Let's have a five minute break. Is that going to be enough? And we'll be back here at ten to to learn about the project management body of knowledge. And I'll do some Q&A then as well. So post some questions. In the meantime, we've got a question now. Can I put the. Sorry, I can't eat properly. Oh, yeah, the Tanya. Can I put them back on the screen? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Hello. So I was writing to you.

SPEAKER 4
Email about transference. So I. Hello? Yeah. And so I still have control here. Okay. Confirm and everything. So. Awesome. So this is gonna start out this week. Okay. But yeah, what's in seminar?

SPEAKER 2
So if you haven't been allocated to it. I'm sorry.

SPEAKER 4
I'm turned on.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. If you haven't been able to get my first date, then just turn up to any of the Seminoles. So they're running from 1 to 4. So I guess 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 and see where in the computer science. So it's CSE 101161. Oh. All right. All right. And you have the rules. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I've just come to come to those but let me have a have a look on tabulate now. I'll do it on here so that nobody can see. You can find out which one's the least busy. And then I think I can.

UNKNOWN
Get you to come to that one immediately.

SPEAKER 2
Okay. So they're all quite equally balanced so you can come to any of them, really? Yeah, I guess it would make sense to maybe come at, say, 2 p.m. because there are two slots then. So that means we'd be able to figure out which one has at least people in between to that one. So if you come at 2 p.m. on Thursday and put into a group, that'd be great.

SPEAKER 4
Sounds good. All right.

SPEAKER 2
Great. Thank you. Is that does that work with your timetable? Absolutely.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah. Fantastic.

UNKNOWN
So cool. Why? And. To.

SPEAKER 2
Okay. So I've got a couple of questions. The first one was, do we get a mark scheme that tutors use? Yes, you will get a mark scheme. You will not just get a mark scheme. I will also gradually ease you into the marking process. So there'll be a self assessment task where you get to self assess your first, your first weeks, your first chapter and it will talk you through the different aspects of the mark scheme there. So you'll get to self-assess your own work and then you appear. Assess the essay of your peers with some advice on how to do that as well. So there'll be a clear mark scheme that hopefully makes it easy for you to do that. Another point here would you would. So if you were to do everything in term one. Would it mark you down for project management because you're not doing anything for term two? I think doing everything in term one is quite a good idea. It adds a very big contingency to your plan and it also means you can extend the project in lots of ways. So yeah, getting everything done in turn one is not a bad project idea. Hopefully if I understood the question, I'm not sure which trade off is being referred to, referred to in the question, you see. So maybe I maybe the question came quite a while earlier, but yes, certainly you wouldn't be marked down for project management if you plan to do everything really early. If anything, that's what people don't do, especially students. Not that I'm stereotyping four of you in pain. I'm sorry about that. I can't do much to help you. Can we use peer review for Css3 ten documents? You'd have to speak to the module organiser for CSE 310 Greg Watson. He'd be able to decide if that was appropriate. I would say, given that your project specifications are not for credit, I don't see why you shouldn't be discussing them with one another and helping each other to improve your project specifications. But it's boring enough writing your own, let alone reading someone else's. So I don't imagine many of you will do that. But it's certainly a good a good idea to look at other people's examples of good project specifications and see what they've done that have been good examples. Okay. Some pictures of pens and fruit. Greggs is good. Great is good. Not very healthy, though. When does exam content starts? We've done a little bit already talking about the iron triangle and we'll do a little bit more. That question keeps coming in, doesn't it? Someone hasn't got the point. Okay. So, yes, that stuff is examined. Well, and we're now going to learn about project management, Body of Knowledge, which is a textbook that I strongly recommend you consult in this module. It's considered essential reading, but only if you want to fall asleep straight away. It's the most boring book in the world. It's like a it's a reference book. So if you read it from cover to cover, I'm very impressed. But it's probably more likely a book that you will dip into and out of. So it's split into the ten knowledge area, so there's a different section for each knowledge area. And within each of those knowledge areas, it's split into smaller groups depending on different phases of the project that you're in. So in the end there are about 49 different methodologies and techniques to do with project management that you can read about. So yeah, it's a very, very detailed book. It contains lots and lots of information. It's not something you're going to recover to cover, but it's very useful to dip into, especially if you're thinking about a particular area of your project. So there are chapters for all of these different things, the things we just talked about scope, time, cost, quality risk, human resources, procurement, stakeholders, communications and integration, right? So I explained earlier what those different things kind of mean. We're going to talk through that now just to make sure you really do know which parts of this book they go into. But first of all, let me describe how this book structured. So the project management body, Body of Knowledge is written by an organisation called the PMI, the Project Management Institute, which is a group of people who consider themselves the leading experts in project management. They consult many project managers and they make decisions of establishing what is the best practice for the industry and what they say is every project more or less follows this formula. There is an initiation stage at the start or initiation Process group. You can call it a stage and call it a process group. The terminology will get very confusing because we're going to use a different methodology in a couple of weeks, which is uses a different notation altogether, but they're called process groups in the project management body of knowledge, right? So you've got initiation. That's when you establish why you're doing the project. What's the business case? How will this make us money? Why are we doing it? Then you move into the planning phase. The planning stage, I should say. That's where you're dealing with this iron triangle of balancing time, cost, scope and all the other things. That's when you're making the plans. Right now, that's not something that is done in a waterfall way up front. You do a bit of planning upfront. Of course, you don't go blindly into implementation without first having a bit of a plan, but you do some planning and then you do some execution. You do some real work, like writing some code or building a system, and then you go back to planning again. You do a bit more planning, you come back and do more execution. This is iterative, right? This is what everybody does in projects, Even if their project has a lot of planning upfront, there is always this process of doing some work updating the plan because new knowledge has arrived. Think of your third year project. You've all written project specifications. That is not a static document, but it's actually a working document. After a week of doing that research, you'll realise that everything you wrote in your in your plan is completely wrong because you hadn't realised how it all works. You could if you wanted to rewrite your project spec with that new information. That's what real project managers need to do. They need to keep that plan constantly up to date. They update their Gantt charts so that they can see if something's going to go wrong further down the line. That's why it's really useful to do all that. Some of that planning up front and have a working document like that. Okay. So planning and execution in a nice loop and all the while that's happening. So the project manager is not really doing much in the execution part. They just sort of sitting around twiddling their thumbs, waiting for someone to say, Something's gone wrong. If that doesn't happen, then they don't have to do any work, right? The project management manager isn't coding. They're not developing. They're not sort of telling people how to do their jobs. It's their job to manage the bigger picture of the plan. So what they are doing in the background is they're doing monitoring and controlling. Right. They are checking, observing certain metrics, checking things are going to plan, looking for red lights that are flashing or people crying or whatever would be the marker of a failed project or a problem. And then they will control if they have to, they will intervene and correct things. So that's kind of happening in the background during the execution phase of the project. And when that whole loop is done and everything's completed, there's a closing stage of the project, which is the last one there. Okay, So it's not particularly groundbreaking. It's just telling you how a project goes about happening, what the sequence of events is going to be. And the book is split into these different sections. Depending on where you are in the project, you'll consult different ones. So this is kind of the chapters of the book, I should say. So you've got sections here across the top for the different process groups that I just mentioned, and you've got all the different ten knowledge areas down this way. And then within here you've got a chapter for each of these different things. These are all the different activities that a project manager might have to do. So there's a lot of stuff there. Those of you with photographic memory can probably just memorise that now. The rest of you are just going to have to sort of study this and make sure you understand what these different things are. Now, I'm not going to test you by saying something really specific like which, you know, which of these activities needs to be done at this point in time, for example, that would just be a bit too mean. I'm less interested in you memorising this stuff. I'm more interested in you understanding how it fits in. So it's worth at least reading it once. So for example, we can look at a few examples, right? So under time and planning. So if you're planning the time aspect of your project, you turn to this section of the report. Okay. What do you need to do? Well, you need to plan schedule management. That's the first thing you might need to do, which is actually planning how you're going to do the planning of time management. There's always kind of like a meta plan at the start of a section. How do you do time management? Will you define the activities that you're going to do? You're going to put them in a sequence, you're going to estimate their durations and you're going to develop a schedule based on that. You probably all went through that exact same process in coming up with your Gantt charts last week and in your product specifications that are due on Thursday. If you read the project management Body of Knowledge, you will read in these sections all the different best practices for doing this. So if you go to estimate activity durations, you'll see there are about 13 different techniques for accurately estimating activity durations. When you wrote your project spec, you probably just plucked in and out of thin air. It'll take about a week. Put that down. There are better techniques than that and it depends on the project you're doing, which one you choose, but there are some very good methods for that. So we're going to learn about those during the course of this lecture series. But for now, where do you find them in the book? It's in this section, right? That's what I want you to learn from this slide, not what all of these things are, but which section they would fit in. Okay, let's look at another section. You've got stakeholder management. So let's say you're trying to manage some tricky stakeholders in a project. Which part of the book do you turn to? Well, you turn to the stakeholder section. What kind of things can the PMI textbook tell you? Well, it can tell you how to identify who those stakeholders are. We're going to do that a little bit later on today when you know who the stakeholders are, you can make a plan for how you're going to engage those stakeholders. Those stakeholders might be really problematic. You might have someone on the project who wants to derail your project. How will you manage that person? How will you make sure they don't ruin the project and cause you a lot of headaches? Once you have a plan for how you're going to do stakeholder engagement, you can put it into practice. So putting it into practice is obviously different from actually doing it. You might have. You might be sending them emails or inviting them out for coffee or whatever. It happens to be schmoozing them. That might be something that you're doing all part of here and you've got to monitor your stakeholder as well. You can't just make a plan and hope it just implement itself. You've got to make sure that your stakeholders are continuously happy with the project. So do you see these are all the different phases of the project initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling. You're doing something with your stakeholders throughout the project. You're keeping them on board. Okay, integration. Now, this is a knowledge area that perhaps is a little bit vague. It shouldn't really be on the dodecahedron because it's not really a constraint that you're managing. But there are lots of areas of management that involve bringing different knowledge areas together. So for example, at the start of a project you need to develop a thing called a project charter. That kind of sets out all the different details of the project. Now it makes sense to put that in one chapter rather than having that in bits all over the different chapters. So I guess that's why you call it integration. In the planning section, you've got a project management plan which again is a plan for everything. So you see lots of planning going on in this integration and integration knowledge area, the managing of project work. Again, it might be maybe things that are not specific to a given knowledge area, but more general to all of them. So again, that's where that would fit. Does that make sense? Why you've got that integration knowledge area. Good. I don't know why I've got that on there, so I'll skip that. Oh, no. Maybe I'm asking you to do something. Am I? Yes, I am. Okay, We'll do an exercise. Okay. So, yeah, get your vox out. We're going to see if you can tell me which knowledge areas correspond to these. A range of activities that would be typical to any project. So we're going to start with the first one here, the breaking of project down into manageable chunks. So hopefully that was a nice, easy one to start with. So we'll try and get these done quickly because we have quite a lot of these to get through. So just stick your answer in super fast and we'll blast through these if possible. Just to provide a bit of a time incentive. I'll stop the poll when half the people have answered. Just to make it sort of a speedy thing. There we are. So stop the poll. I'll give you I'll give you a little bit longer. There we go. We'll stop it there. Okay. So. Oh, interesting. Okay. Okay. So this is a bit mixed. Okay, so. Oh, no, just the bars are wrong, so ignore the length of the bars. But 24 people have said scope and that would, of course, be the right answer. Right. The idea that you're breaking it down into chunks of the features that you're going to do, those chunks are the scope of the project. Now, of course, once you have those chunks, you can then do time management, right? These things link to one another, right? These knowledge areas aren't treated in isolation. You need to have done this scope management before you can do your time management. Okay. Ensuring a product meets its specification. So which knowledge area does that concern? Or you could get the answers coming in fast this time. It's good to see. All right. The numbers have started easing off. I'm going to stop the poll there. Okay, so there we go. The bar looks to make sense this time. 47 people have identified that this is a quality item. The specification is defining the quality of the scope. So a few have said scope, but the answer is indeed quality. So well done for spotting that quality is the measurement of of the scope items. So that's what it is. The product, meaning the specification is indeed a quality thing. Okay. I already give you a hint of this earlier when? So which knowledge area concerns the schmoozing with influential parties? Now project managers get to do this a lot. They consider it a very important part of their job. I'm sure it is. Which knowledge area is this? Does this fit in? Okay, very good. The answer coming in very fast here. So you clearly understand this stuff. Excellent. Yep. So the vast majority there have correctly identified that this is a stakeholder management thing. It's important to network and keep your stakeholders happy. So that's where schmoozing happens. Stakeholders are those influential parties that we just talked about. Very good. Okay. When do you bring the team together to start the work? Now give this a bit more thought, this one, because this is usually incorrectly answered. This is where they start to get a bit tricky, so. Which knowledge area? Concerns, bringing the project team together to start the work. Now, it may feel like there are several areas where this might fit. So that's why I've sort of. Put this one here to think about. So I'll end the poll and let's see what you think. Okay. So many people there have identified that this is a resources thing. This is a management of human resources. Resources, of course, means human resources. It means the management of people. So that seems like a sensible answer, a non not insignificant number of. Also consider this might be an integration area because it concerns multiple knowledge areas, but it is resources. Okay. And in fact. Oh, and the bars are very misleading there. But an equally large number had said communications. Now, of course, communications are involved in almost every area of project management. Communications management is managing how you're going to communicate. So. This act of communicating and bringing people together to do some work isn't specifically a communication management thing. It's a human management thing. Does that make sense? Why? It's not a communication thing, because that's an important distinction, I think. Good. Okay. Directing the project work. Okay. I'll give you a few more seconds. Get your answers in if you can. Very good. So directing the project works. So the project work. So let's see the look at these numbers. So. Okay, interesting. So large number there are going with communications. Slightly fewer are going to gone with integration. Those are kind of the main guesses there. So it's an integration thing. Okay, so directing the project work may involve different areas of different knowledge areas you're going to perhaps need to deal with issues of time management or cost management. When you're directing the project work. The decisions of project manager makes in that situation may involve different knowledge areas, so that's why it fits into the integration category. Again, not a communications thing, although there's a lot of communication involved in the directing of project work. You're not managing the communications, you are just doing communication in order to integrate the areas of the project to make it go to plan. So similar to the last one, you need to be careful about these ones now. Mitigating delays when an anticipated problem arises. That seems like a relatively simple one, so hopefully you can get that one in quickly. Okay, I'll stop the poll there. So. I think. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. Okay. Maybe this is a bit tricky. Okay, fine. So. Yeah. I guess this is a bit ambiguous actually thinking about it. So I immediately thought where it should go, but maybe it could go in either of those. So clearly responding to the risk is what most people have said they're responding to. The risk is an important thing to do, but we're dealing with a delay. So there's a time management component there. I put this down as a risk management thing and that's where I think it would fit. I suppose they would perhaps need to be some time management involved. But really the emphasis here is on a problem has arisen. We need to mitigate that problem. Whether the problems of delay or a budget overrun or something else, the methodology is the same. It's a risk management problem, but you may need to go back to your time planning, of course, and use that time planning to correct things. Okay. Shopping around for the best prices of goods and services. Where does that fit in? Which knowledge area? So if you have any skills of elimination, you should be able to work out now which ones are left and which ones we haven't done already. So we'll try and go through these last couple quite quickly shopping around. That's a procurement thing. It's not a cost thing. So cost management is dealing with the project costs. The procurement is a separate is one of those costs will be the things you need to buy to implement to do the project. So procurement is that very thing of buying stuff to to do the project work. You may decide during your cost management whether you're going to procure stuff or if you're going to do stuff in-house. That's where in cost management you'll be making those decisions. But once you've decided to go with a procurement route, then it becomes a procurement management thing. Hopefully that makes sense why that fits there. And then finally deciding who needs to be kept informed and updated during the project. So this one. I think you should. Be able to do relatively easily. Well, actually, again, it can seem to fall into two, can't it, with any of these things. It kind of overlaps different different areas here. But this one in particular is. Until closing the poll. Okay. So majority of that I say communications management and I think you're right. But this could also be a stakeholder management thing. Yeah, this is probably falls into the remit of communications. Finally. It's the thing where you're planning the communications across a broad range of different types of people. I could also accept stakeholder there. I think that's also a good answer. Okay, let's have a look at the leaderboard. Here we are. Well done, Oliver. Good work. I'll give you a moment to put yourself on there. Very good. Okay, now we're going to do the same ten tasks or eight tasks, so eight tasks, but this time we're going to match them to the process. Group Now you're all familiar with these tasks, so this should be quite easy. But which process group, which phase of the project would you be doing those things in? So it's the same it's the same kind of question, but we're now putting them in the different different dimensions, so breaking down the project into manageable chunks. So we recall that that was a scope management thing. When do we do that? Okay, stop the poll there. Well, the vast majority of people there have correctly said planning. The task that we're doing here is we're defining it's called define scope. It's a scope management thing that fits in our planning phase of the project. So well done. You probably do a bit of breaking down the project during initiation, but not to the level of detail that you would do in the planning phase. So this is definitely a very much a planning task. Okay, ensuring products meet their specification. Now we recall this was quality management, but when do you do it? So you've created some products. During the project, you're now going to assess whether they meet their specification. Let's see if you can tell me when we do that. Okay. So yeah, it was either going to be execution or monitoring of controlling. But it is indeed monitoring and controlling. So well done. So these seem very easy for you. That's good. Okay. When do we do that? Schmoozing with influential parties. Now. I think this is a bit of a bit of a vague one. You could potentially do this at any point. When does it usually get done? Now, there's actually a specific area in the PMBoK guide telling you how to schmooze with influential parties. So. That's what I'm referring to when I say, when does this get done? So let's stop the poll there. Okay. So what you need to realise is the project management body of knowledge is telling you how to do different things at different stages of their life cycle. Now this is actually an execution thing because it's the execution of the stakeholder management, right? You're putting into practice, the stakeholder management, you do very little in initiation. Initiation is literally just getting things set up to start the project. You don't do any, you know, team building or anything like that. You're literally just creating a document in initiation. There's very little to be said in the project management body of knowledge. Now, in reality, you probably need to a bit of lobbying and schmoozing and things like that to get people on board to get the project to happen. But that's not what happens in the project management body of knowledge because that book is not about the business organisation environment, it's about the project environment. So within the project itself, the project is assumed to be already, you know, approved and happening. So the kind of schmoozing you're imagining isn't the kind of schmoozing that the PMI textbook is talking about. So this is a managing stakeholder engagement thing. It's happening during the project. As the project goes along, you need to keep people on board so that they keep doing their jobs properly. Okay. When do you bring the project team together to start the work? Okay, let's get the answers in and I'll stop the poll now. Very good. So you have said mixture here, very big mixture. So we've got the majority, we are saying at project execution, some have said at planning and a small number of said initiation. Well, those we were listening when I described the previous one. We don't do anything like that initiation. We're just drawing up some documents. So it's not initiation and it's actually execution. Okay. So even when we're planning a project, we don't bring the team together. We don't get the team ready. The team aren't just sitting around doing nothing. They're probably working on other stuff. They've probably got day jobs that they're doing. You only bring them together to do the work at execution stage. So managing the team, dealing with, you know, team building and all that kind of thing, that's all happening during that execution phase of the project. Okay. Directing the project work. When does that happen? Okay. Get the answers in. So let's stop the poll there. When do we direct the project work? Well, most people have said it's somewhere between execution and monitoring and controlling. I would have said something along the same lines. You're not doing any directing of the project work at the planning stage that's preparing the project work, deciding what the project work's going to be. But directing is kind of the active act of saying right now, do this, do this and telling people what to do. So I would say it's somewhere between the two, but it's an execution thing. According to the project management Body of Knowledge, right? There's a specific chapter called directing manage project work, and it's to do with execution. Now, monitoring controlling is happening behind the scenes of execution. That's why it doesn't fit into there. You're directing the project work by saying, right, this team, you're going to go and work on that. You're telling them exactly how to do that work. You're not behind the scenes monitoring variables, monitoring key performance indicators to decide how things are going. We've got a hand up at the back.

SPEAKER 5
This one seemed like you would.

SPEAKER 2
It's a luxury. I agree. I agree. So what I'm trying to say is that directing is kind of like an active way of controlling the project, whereas monitoring and controlling is it's got the word controlling in there. It's kind of measuring things that are going on and when things go wrong, interfering. So it's kind of more of like a risk management thing going on, whereas the execution is like the business as usual, ordinary running of the project. Does that make sense? I agree. That's a tricky one. It's not it's not immediately obvious at face value what that means. So it was a good question. Thank you. Okay. Mitigating a delay when an anticipated problem arises. I've possibly given the answer away just now, but. I guess this also could vaguely fit into two. I mean, part of the problem is here I've written these examples, but there are multiple ways of dealing with these kinds of things, I suppose. So that's that's probably where the ambiguity comes from. So, yeah, majority of people there have said monitoring, controlling. That's where I think this fits. Of course, the actual mitigating of the delay, the dealing with the delay might be replanning, you see. So on this example here, they've actually given multiple entities that have given monitoring risks. That's observing the problem arising and that's what's happening behind the scenes. But then there's the thing of implementing the risk response that becomes an active execution task for the project manager. So these I guess I guess these acts here, these verbs here aren't necessarily the phases of the project lifecycle. They may be thought of as being kind of the verb associated with the task that the person is doing, the manager is doing as well, which just adds an extra confusion as to where they fit again in an exam situation. I'm not going to be expecting you to know exactly where these things fit. Just understanding these things is useful in its for its own sake. Okay, so when do we shop around for the best prices of goods and services? Okay, I'll stop the poll in a second. Get your answers in. There we go. Okay, so good. So we've got lots of people suggesting planning there. That is indeed your planning. You're planning the procurements, you're planning how you're going to buy stuff, what you're going to buy, working out, what things are going to going to cost there. So yeah, that's definitely part of a plan. Very sensible. And finally, deciding who needs to be kept informed and updated during the project. Okay. And let's see if Oliver can maintain his lead on the leaderboard. So pressure's on now. Final question. So I'll stop the poll now. Okay. So the fact that this is deciding who needs to be kept informed rather than actively informing them means it's probably not an execution thing or monitoring. So it's going to be a planning thing. So this is planning the communications management. So well done to the majority of the class there. Okay, Let's look at that leaderboard. Here we go. Drum roll. Aha. We have a new leader. Well done, Amelia. Good work. All right. I'll wait till everyone's had a quick look at that. Very good. Okay, so now you know what this book is about. You know the kinds of things it teaches you about. I do recommend you dip into that when you're thinking about your third year projects, if you may find it useful. It may be a little bit corporate for some of the things that you'll be doing in your third year projects, but there might be some good ideas in there that you might find useful. You may also want to dip into this book. When you're writing your essays, you almost certainly will. It will help you to put some of the things I teach you into a broader context and compare it to other possible approaches you could have taken that would be really useful in your essays. Because I'm not just assessing you on describing what you've done in the seminars, but actually the critical discussion about that. So this might be a very useful reference to have in your essay. Okay, so why is this good book? Well, it's like a big checklist. It helps you not forget things. It's nicely structured. It's easy to find things. It's easy to understand. There's nothing, you know, shockingly complicated in there. It's simple for anyone to really understand. And the project management, the PMI approach is quite flexible. It's not constraining, it's not saying you have to follow this methodology, you have to follow these steps. It's just saying he's a whole load of great techniques that we consider best practice. You should use them. So I've put this down as sort of homework. I don't expect you to sort of memorise these things, but study the list of the processes and we'll do a little bit of a quiz just to see if you have understood these different things for next week. So don't spend long on that, but just have a quick look. I'm not expecting you to memorise them word for word or exactly where they fit, but hopefully the activity we just did should be enough to prepare many of you. So. Okay, We've got all of this knowledge now we've got the textbook. What do we do with it? So the very first thing we do in the guide, the very first thing we have to do is produce a document called a project charter. So let's have a look. Well, another document is called a project mandate. So this is apparently what Google thinks a mandate is. When I think of mandate, I think of Boris Johnson, who used the word mandate a lot. If you look in the dictionary, Amanda is an official order or commission to do something right. It's the kind of the the signing off authority. It's the permission to go ahead. Boris Johnson thought he had permission to go ahead and ruin the economy because people voted for Brexit. That's the kind of thing, right? He used the election results as a mandate to deliver Brexit. He used that as as the authority he gave that gave his position a lot of credibility. So every project starts with a thing called a project mandate, and it sets out what you want to build. The reason it's called a mandate is because there's going to be a big signature at the end saying, Yes, you have permission to begin, right? So what do you put in a project mandate? It's a statement of work. It is saying, what is the project, what's included and what's not? That's the scope. What are the constraints such as money and time? Any assumptions, any risks, Any issues? It's not a big document, right? It's probably a piece of paper, probably back of an envelope. It's just like that, that initial idea. This is what I want to do. Can I go ahead and start? Yes, you can. That's your mandate. That's how a project starts. Another ingredient that you need to start a project once perhaps you've got the mandate is a business case. It might be handed in alongside the mandate saying Why do we want to build it? So what do we want to build? Project mandate? Why do we want to build it? What's it going to do? What benefits is it going to deliver? So a project must deliver value, of course, to its to the business. It can be on time, it can be on budget. But the most important thing is, is it going to deliver value? Is it worth doing that stuff? Is it worth spending £1 million in the project? Is it worth the effort? And the business case might also fit in the context of other things that are going on in the business. There may be an overarching strategic plan. You might be doing this project alongside ten others. There may be a programme of projects. Therefore it needs to sort of fit within that context and make sense. So there's a business case. It's often a lot more complex than just this spreadsheet here that I put together. If it was that simple, then yeah, I think there wouldn't be much work for board meetings and things like that. But the business case is very useful. At the start of a project, it sets out the goals, right? It sets up the goals for the stakeholders. It motivates them to think, right. This project is going to deliver great benefits to my team. I'm on board. During the project. You can then refer back to that business case and it will guide the key decisions because you promised to achieve this, this and this for these different people. Are you still on track to doing that? And at the end of the project you can look at your spreadsheet and say, well, actually this is what we business, this is our business, Case said. In reality, the numbers were very different. We have learned some valuable lessons. We should never have gone ahead with this project or the project. You can improve, improve the model so your budget or something like that, right? So you can learn from it. So the business case is kind of a. A high level set of goals that are driving the project. Every project should start with a clear set of goals, a bit like the problem statements that you set out in your project specs. Now, if you look at the PMBoK guide, you will see that there is no business case. There is no project mandate. Oops went the wrong way. So they don't exist in the world of PMI because it's it's thought of that they are outside of a project. The idea and the reason for the project are assumed. Everything else the project manager does is not so so what the PMI approach is assuming that the project manager doesn't do any of the creative inventive, the innovating in the project, what they do is the implementation of the management, but they they're appointed after the project has already been sanity checked, signed off, given a budget. Now that's something that you may want to discuss or debate. It's something that I think is perhaps unusual. And the other approach that we're going to learn in this in this course is, is is Prince two, which is very much focussed on the business case. And that does make it the project managers responsibility to sanity check the goals of the project rather than just be told these are the goals, go and do them. So there's a difference between the two approaches in terms of that philosophy. So I think it's important to point that out. But the project probably still does start with a mandate and a business case, and they feed into a thing called a project charter. So you might think that, well, the Project Charter is just all of that and we can just save. Having a whole chapter in the book would be a waste of paper. Let's just put it all into one. So that's also another way of viewing it. So you might not think it's so philosophical after all. So the project charter, then? What's that? Well, before we do that. Does anyone know what this is? Because I realise I've just been rambling on about very boring documents, so let's. Oh, it's crashed. Again.

SPEAKER 6
How annoying. Okay.

SPEAKER 2
So I've answered that question about the mark scheme, so I'll hide that one in the best module. Thank you very much. Seven. Thumbs up. Brilliant. Make it eight. Kapow! Thank you. Someone's too hot. I'm very sorry about the heat. I think it's cooler. Lower down. Just like the fart problem last week. If you come to the front, it'll be cooler. There is no cheat sheet for the exam. It was discussed last year. We determined that it wasn't necessary for this module. It's not a technically heavy module. You don't need a cheat sheet. I'm not going to be testing you on bookwork. I'm going to be testing you in your critical thinking. So a cheat sheet won't be provided. Has PowerPoint started up yet? Come on. Can you change all parts of the submission until the final submission? Yes, you can. So the interim submission is chapters one and two. You can then look at the ideas of all of your peers. You can steal their ideas if you want to. You can rewrite chapters one and two and get a fresh set of markers for the final submission. So yes, you can improve your essay before the final submission and I strongly encourage you to do so. You also don't have to if you don't want to. You can perhaps just make a few adjustments here and there. That's probably more efficient use of your time, given you've got two more chapters to write out to that point. Good questions. Let me get to the slide. There we go. I hope he's not going to crash again. I lost the connection. You can still answer the question. So does anyone know what that is?

SPEAKER 5
Yes.

SPEAKER 2
What kind of pen?

SPEAKER 5
Do you think sort of.

SPEAKER 2
Anyone got a better guess? A witch pen. The pen. Is that what you were going to say as well? We've got some got some national experts in the room. It is indeed the NASA pen. Now, if I can find my mouse, I can show you it. This is NASA's space pen. Oh, sorry. My very slow motion animation there was about to. I'm supposed to reveal it in slow mo.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah. Here we are.

SPEAKER 2
This is NASA's space pen. NASA spent millions and millions of pounds on developing a pen that could write in space. And this is a picture of famous astronaut. I don't know his name. You might know his name. He's probably called Cunningham. Doing it, using it. And here it is. Look, the Fisher Space pen. He comes with the guarantee, of course. Now, these are some of the features I'm going to give you the advert Fixer, tropic ink ink that solid until it's activated and then becomes a liquid so it can right then become solid again so it doesn't float around in space in general, all the machinery. Right. Very important in space pressurised cartridge because there's no gravity to load it. Right. So you've got to you've got to press that little button on the side to push the ink through the nozzle as you write. And yours for only $1 million. Okay. So I'm exaggerating a little bit, but this is NASA's space pen. Um. What went wrong with the space pen project? Does anyone know? So this is a text answer thing. So just write 1 or 2 words for what was wrong with this project and we'll see if you know. You have to press, submit or send when you've written your text. So I'm going to stop the poll there because I'm concerned. A little bit about time. But let's stop it there. So what went wrong with the space plane project? Well, to me, quite clearly a lack of common sense. Apparently the the Russians just took a pencil and that is what the majority of people have identified. But more fundamentally, you know, I don't know if it did go over budget, but it was certainly incredibly expensive. That's that's definitely true. A pencil, certainly. So you've obviously heard this story before. Not necessarily. This. Interesting. So some people think a normal pen works? No, it doesn't. Normal pen doesn't work in space. It was motivated by genuine, a genuine problem. It did solve that problem. However, the reasons for the project were not not well, certainly to to a layperson, for the purpose of this this lecture. It was there was a lack of common sense. Why did they bother to do this when they could have used a pencil? Now, having spoken about this to a NASA expert last year, it turns out that maybe there was also justification for this pen. And this pen is actually used actively by the Russians and the Americans. Now, everybody uses these pens because actually, I think pencils aren't always suitable in some situations. Maybe the Led freezes or something, I don't know. There are situations where this pencil is this pen is actually very useful, but the project itself and the example, the point I suppose I'm trying to make is that common sense, having a clear justification for why you're doing the project is very important. You need to have the project manager aware of the business case so that they can question whether the approach taken is appropriate for the situation. Okay. So that was like an aside on. It's really important to motivate and have a clear business case for your project. Now let's get back to the boring stuff. Now that I've woken you up, the Project Charter is another document. This document is the one that formally authorises the existence of the project. So we had the mandate, which was the initial signatory on the idea, saying Yet fair enough, this project has is based on sound common sense. Yes, you should do the project. The project charter is where you assign authority and a budget and actually start doing the project. So this is the formal document that starts the project. Does that make sense? The difference in the mandate, in the charter, that's kind of a typical exam question kind of thing. So it's important to realise that there's a there's a distinction here. One feeds into the other. And if you look in the project management body of knowledge, you'll see that the inputs to a charter are the project mandate. What are we going to do? The business case? Why are we doing it? What is it worth the required investment? So those are the key ingredients of this, but also the other stuff that an organisation has, right? Memorandums of understanding, service level agreements, contracts, any kind of legal mumbo jumbo that has to be parcelled into every single project you do, that knowledge is going to influence the way you do a project. So you need to know that stuff before you do a project. You can't just switch preferred supplier or something at a whim, right? You have to do what the organisation has agreed that you will do. So there are those external constraints in a project that, you know, for smaller projects you might not have to worry about these things, but it's something that businesses do need to think about. There are other external factors like quality standards, that you have to obey certain professional standards. There are lots of different rules that you have to follow, legal rules. You can't just sort of break the law. You have to do a project following the law, right? All of these external factors that need to be thought about and then things within the organisation like the way we do things here. Lesson log from previous projects, past experience, the knowledge and expertise within the organisation. All of that feeds in to making a project charter. Those are the inputs. What comes out the other end? The justification for the project plan. Okay, So the purpose or justification, why are we doing this? The thing that really justifies why we're doing it, not just we're doing it to get benefits for these people, but justifying why we're doing this project for these people. We're not just going to make a space pen because we can't write it with a pen in space. We're doing it because it's the only solution to these problems. And we've explored all these others, including pencils, and they're not good enough. That justification is what comes into the project charter. Measurable objectives, success criteria. These are things that you're putting in your project spec, aren't they? The requirements, the boundaries, risks and constraints. Schedule with the key milestones all the way along so you can make progress towards that final goal. A budget. How are you going to get there? Can you afford to get there? Who's the. Who are the stakeholders? Who do you need to schmooze? Who? The sponsors. Where is the money coming from? Who's the project manager? Who's going to lead the management? Who's got the signature? Who can sign this off? And if something goes wrong, allow us to change the plan. All of these different things are what come out of that. So that's what's going to be in your final document, right? So we can we can summarise these things. You know, you've got the goals of the project, the scope, a plan, sort of the people. These are the ingredients of a project. The project management body of knowledge, of course, tells us to factor all these things in and come up with an initial plan for the project, an initial high level plan, a project specification or a project charter. Okay. Some examples. There's one, as you can see. Description, scope, business case, some constraints, some benefits. Who are the people involved? What the risks. Right. Just it's a template for a project spec, isn't it? Life's not working. Oh, come on. It's crashed again. Apologies. Never had a crashing slide before. It's not even a fancy slide deck. Yes, you can change the slides, as I said. We've answered that one already. Oops. Crayola crayons base sounds pretty good. It might melt. I don't know. There are different kind of I think. I'm sure there are different reasons. It's a pen. Yeah. How do you define integration management? It's the management area where different things are brought together. Multiple knowledge areas are brought together. Let me get back to my slides. Okay. I don't know if I got any more poles left, but let's connect it anyway. So look at your project spec. This is the from the website. These are the things you need to include. Things like a title, a problem statement. The gap identified the objectives, the methods timetable. These are the things that you need to include in your project spec. And of course. Can I not change that? And of course, just in just the same way they can be broken down into things like the goals, the scope, the plan, no consideration I guess, of people in your project spec. So perhaps there's a gap. Or maybe your project doesn't involve external people. If it does. Have you considered it? Have you managed those people? So recap then. We start with the business case telling us why we're doing the project and the project mandate, telling us what we're doing. So we've got the goals. We've got a rough idea of the scope, i.e. the boundaries of the features that we're going to do and assigning of authority. We bring all that together to produce a document called the Project Charter or a project brief is another word for it, or a project specification is what you're calling it in your third year project that details how we're going to do the project. Okay. The what? The why in the how, You know, those are the components for any sensible initial plan for a project. That's how we initiate a project by getting those elements all together. Realistically, you go round in circles until all these things are thoroughly understood and fleshed out. But that's project initiation. So now let's move on to the final part. We're going to talk about stakeholders. Now, we talked last week a little bit about what the project managers do. We establish that they spend a lot of their time dealing with people communicating. And I found a quote here. It has been said that 90% of a project managers time is spent communicating. No reference from the paper that mentioned that. But the fact that it has been said might mean there's some truth to it. This is somebody had published their daily timetable as a project manager, what they do with their life and they've categorised it all and they it seems to me like about 40% of their time is spent doing communication management probably means sending emails. I suppose that's how they've catalogued that, spent some of their time doing cost management research. You know, a little bit of time here and there doing other things. So, you know, the vast majority of a project managers time is communicating. Dealing with people, dealing with problems that arise. Handling those problems. So communication is clearly very important and managing people is what you communicate for. That's how human beings communicate. So. Who are the project stakeholders? Well, there are lots of different stakeholders in a typical project. There may be a sponsor. That's the person who funds the project. That's where the money comes from to make the project happen. They provide resources. They might lead the project or they might have hands off approach. There are different types of sponsors to a project, but the sponsor is usually the person who they put the money forward because they want this project done. They're the person often who had the idea they might be the person who wrote the mandate or, you know, they're the person who had the idea in the first place. So they are interested in the project. They have an active interest in the project going their way, but they probably also, because they've got the money, they have a lot of influence in the project. So they're also a stakeholder who perhaps needs to be carefully considered so that you can manage them effectively. There are many other kinds of stakeholders, not just the people who are not just the customer who's asking for the product, but there are customers and users of a product which is perhaps going out to a larger market. The users of the product, the users of the service that you're making, the users of the result of the thing that you're doing. So those people are interested in the project. They care about what you're making. You probably should probably ask for them, you know, before you make a piece of software for thousands of people. You asked anyone about it or are you just going to use your intuition and gut instinct to just, you know, make it and hope you're right? Probably going to ask them and find out what interests them so that you can sell it to them at the end of the day. There are people who are suppliers or sellers, people who want to provide components or services for your project. Somebody might be providing a part that you're going to buy. You know, those people have an involvement in your project. There are there are many other types of stakeholders. There are partners, people, organisations that are kind of associated with yours that have a connection. Internal groups. Often the projects come by bringing together different groups within one organisation to say, I want this person, this person, this person to come together and build me this new thing, right? Most people are doing the business as usual stuff. When there's a project, you need to find people within the organisation to come together and actually start doing it. There are managers within the organisation, there are, you know, lots of other people, right? So I'm not going to read through this slide. You can read through it in your own time because I'm finding this slide very dull. I'm going to move on to a bit of an activity again because I think that's the way to to think about these things better. So when we've got a list of our stakeholders, when we know who's involved, what we can do is we can categorise those people into two different streams. Those with power or influence and those with interest. So any person you can gauge how much power they've got and how much interest they've got. Power. What does that mean? That means how much influence they have on the project. Can they ruin the project if they want to? Can they shape the project? Do they have a direct involvement in what happens with this project? Their interest is how much they want and involvement in this project. If they're not interested, but they have a lot of power, then they could be problematic, right? Because if they decided they certainly didn't like the project, they could stop it. So those people with a lot of power and not much interest need to keep them satisfied. They're important. They're dangerous. So we need to involve them. We engage them. We consult them because they pose a risk to the project. And our aim is to sort of increase their interest in the project. So these powerful, influential people, we need to get them on board with our project because they are the people who might derail it. If we can manage to move them into this category of perhaps manage closely. So that's that one there we can we need to involve them in discussions and engage them regularly. We don't want them to lose that interest. We've got them on board. They're interested in our project. They're prepared to support us and use their influence to help our project succeed. We need to make sure we keep them on board and don't annoy them. If we do, they might change their mind and again spoil the project. So you've got to keep your enemies close. I suppose that's probably true. So managing them closely is how you deal with with those high risk individuals. Now, some people don't have much power in a project. I'm in this category here, the monitor category. They've got low power, low influence, and they're not interested in project. These are people who aren't really relevant to the project. Potentially we might need to keep them informed, but we don't need to have a high priority for them. They're not the kind of people we need to worry about. We can save our resources and not worry about them at all probably. It would be good, perhaps if we could increase their interest because they may be beneficial, They may be useful at some point, but it's probably not so important. People in this bottom right are the keep informed category. These are people who are very interested in the project, but they don't have much influence or power over it. They're the people who may be the end users of the project, people we need to involve and consult because they're interested. Why are they interested? There may be a reason for that. We should understand these people. They may be our customers, but they may not have much, much power. Influence. Can we find a way to make use of their interests so that they can improve or benefit the project in some way? So these people in the top segment, these are the ones who we're worried about. These are the ones we're managing. These are the ones we're schmoozing. These are the people that we need to worry about with the project, the ones at the bottom. These are potential opportunities for the project to try and help us. So let's put some people into this grid and see if we understand where people fit and what kind of relationship we need to have with those kinds of stakeholders. So let's start with the client. So we're back again on vbox. Which of the four boxes do we need to put the client into? So the client is the customer, the person who asked us to make the project, I suppose. Okay. Your answers in. The client. The client is clearly an important part of the project. They are the people who have asked us to do it in the first place. So most people here have said manage closely. Some have said keep informed. They think they haven't got a lot of influence or power. It obviously depends what the project is. You have to kind of it's difficult to know exactly which project this is. Different situations might result in different things, but I think managed closely is the correct answer. So well done to those who've got that right. Okay. The CEO of the organisation, remember, projects happen within an organisation, but they aren't. They don't define the organisation. The CEO will be overseeing many programmes of projects, many hundreds of projects. They're far more important than your project. So where does the CEO fit? Hopefully. Well, probably giving it away with my rambling on. But let me stop the poll there. Most of you have said correctly, I assume keep satisfied, which is exactly right. The CEO could be very dangerous to your project. You must make sure you keep them on board. Otherwise they could just pull the plug and say, No, we're not doing that project after all. Okay. The government then where do the government fit in the power interest grid for a generic project? Obviously, if the project is commissioned by the government and they're the client, it's a very different thing. Let's imagine not let's focus on very generic, ordinary kind of software IT project. Where would the government fit into that? Okay, I'll stop the poll there and we'll see what you think most people have said. Monitor. They've said the government hasn't got much power or influence over our project. I think it's somewhere in between monitor and keep satisfied. I would put it on the side of keep informed. Have I Interesting. It's surprising. Why did I do that, I wonder. Let me see if I run it down. Okay. So I put them in. Keep informed, I suppose. I think that's wrong. I think that's wrong. Why would the government be interested in your project? They wouldn't, would they? No, that's wrong. Never mind. Ignore that one. There may be situations in which the government would be interested in your project, but I think you've. Yeah, you've perhaps a bit big for yourself if you think the government cares about your project. I suppose they would care about your project if and I suppose it may be in the keeping form category because the government may care if you're perhaps going to break the law or not follow the regulation. And perhaps if this is a project where you're dealing with the government and regulators, you will need to keep the government informed so that they can you know, the government, I guess, does have an interest in the outcome of your project if it's going to be polluting the sea or doing something bad, right? So yeah, I would say most I.t projects don't fall into this category. They're not going to have the government as a stakeholder, but if it did, perhaps they would be interested. Otherwise they wouldn't be listed as a stakeholder. Maybe that's why it's there. Who knows? Let's move on. Okay. Admin staff within your organisation, where do they fit? Okay, let's stop the poll there. So you're hoping with that last example, you realise that there isn't a black and white single answer for some of these things. You can probably make an argument in a case for each of the different boxes, for different people depending on the project, depending on the situation. So admin staff probably in the monitor category. I think that's, that's quite straightforward. Good suppliers to the project, then these are people who are going to be providing things that your product that your project will need. So that could be staff that could be outsourced, resources that could be equipment. So where do these supplies fit? I think a lot of the time when you think of supplies, you think of external parties, people who perhaps you want to buy something from and you want to get a good price out of them. So I think I'm going to start the poll there. I think there's a common feeling that you're not that bothered about keeping your suppliers interested. So most people have said keep satisfied there. They think suppliers can potentially hold some power over us by, for example, not selling us something or trying to cause us problems. And I think that's the right answer. Sometimes suppliers may have more interest in our project because our supplier may be dependent on us, for if we are their only purchaser, they may be dependent on us for their business. So there may be a reciprocal relationship there. So they may be interested, they may really want to have a, you know, they may be interested in the success of our project. But yeah, I think keep satisfied is a reasonable answer then that's where it belongs on that slide. Okay. Developers, where do they fit? These are the people within your organisation who are probably going to be doing the work of implementing the project, writing the code, whatever happens to be. So hopefully you are as you're all computer scientists, you'll realise that developers are very important to a project. They are people who can they have power and influence because they writing the code. They have interest because they are doing the work. So they are most certainly people who you need to manage closely. You need to keep them on board, you need to keep your developers happy. Very good. The general public now, I guess similar to the government, let's assume the general public are going to perhaps use our product at some point in the future. Maybe, maybe we're making a website or something like that. So where would they fit? Okay, let's stop the poll there. So I think this could fit in either box. It could probably be on the edge. Most people have said monitor public aren't really necessarily that interest in our product, not yet anywhere. We haven't advertised it heavily. So yeah, I think that seems pretty safe. Oh, keep informed. Interesting. I got it wrong as well. I would have said monitor the public. We certainly need to keep informed. Oh, where's it gone?

SPEAKER 5
Doing it again? No, thanks.

SPEAKER 2
Okay. Something went strange there. Okay. Okay. So the public are now being monitored. That's good. I don't know how that happened. Very strange. Okay. The media finally then where do the media fit? I'm going to close the poll very quickly because I know that you can do process of elimination and figure out where it fits. So only if you are fast enough will you get any points for correctly telling me that the media need to be kept informed. They are hopefully interested in our project again, not necessarily right. The media could be highly influential and uninterested and it would be our goal to get the media interested in order to to leverage that. So again, some of these answers are vague and imprecise. You need to look at the specific instance of the project that you're dealing with to know where things go. Ultimately, though, once you've done this, once you've categorised people, you can now manage them. You know what to do. This this power interest grid tells you what you need to do with each of those different people that you've identified. And of course, your aim is to always increase interest in your project. The project is more likely to succeed if you have more people on that side, especially the powerful influential ones, moving them in that direction because that's how a project gets done by people being motivated to make it happen. So let's finally look at the leaderboard. Amelia has maintained her lead. Well done. Good work, everyone. Hopefully you can see your name on there. If not, better luck next time. Average score of 9.9 out of 31. That's okay, I suppose. Recap Project management. It's a balancing act. It's about this weird triangle that nobody really understands. But ultimately there are trade-offs to be made. You have to figure out what to do. We've learned about the course textbook. Don't claim that you haven't learned about it. Now I expect you all to read it all and have some great bedtime reading. With that, you've learned about starting up initiating your projects. Hopefully you're initiating your own third year projects on Thursday, if not before that. So well done with that work and we'll learned about different stakeholders and how you manage them, different things like that. So these are all the exam content parts of today's session. Next time this week seminar you'll be assigned to a team. Please make sure everything we get everything sorted and that you're allocated Chase up DSG support if you haven't been allocated. If you haven't enrolled, please do so as soon as possible. If you haven't been allocated to a slot by Thursday, just turn up. But please try to be allocated with a lot of the ways it causes all manner of headaches. Some homework may be might be worth reading. The case studies that we're going to be working through on Thursday before the session. If you don't get time to do that, there will be time at the very beginning of the session, so please arrive on time. There are some exercises to help you practice the PMBoK knowledge areas for next week's quiz. If you go to this page here and next, we're going to be talking about scope and time management in the lecture. So that is all for today. I apologise for the crashing lectures. Hopefully that won't happen again. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. Let me find a thing. Oh, yeah. Go. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'll just stop this recording. This is.
