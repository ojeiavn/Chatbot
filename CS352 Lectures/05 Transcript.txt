Okay, I guess I'll get started. It sounds like the microphones have been fixed. My request to it got in there. Apologies to those of you who attended online last week and didn't get get to hear me look at you. So today we're going to be talking about budgeting and forecasting. And because this is Halloween we're going to add a bit of a Halloween twist. We're going to call it bludgeoning and fair casting. Unfortunately forecasting is not a word. So this is useless. But the principle is the same. You're going to be horrified whether I teach you about budgeting or bludgeoning. They're both equally horrific things. But before we do that, let's do a recap on the Prince two stuff. Hopefully you enjoyed last week's guest lecture. Of course we learned about the Prince due processes. There are seven of those compared to the five in PMBoK. We'll learn about the different roles and we got to enjoy the role play on Thursday where you all got to try out being different members of the board. We'll learn about the seven themes, which are kind of similar to the principles, but not quite just sort of a different way of intersecting. Prince two. We're talking about all the different management products, all the documents that you need to produce the bureaucracy of Prince two. So I wanted you to see if you can remember the Prince two principles. So don't don't consult your notes or Google it or whatever. We'll just get warmed up with a bit of a bit of a quiz. So what are the Seven Prince do principles to try and submit one word for each principle. So if, for example, one of the principles was write lots of documentation, then write documentation. For example, I'll give you a hint that isn't one of them. So everyone should submit seven different words in their answer here. Hopefully when I end, this poll will be exactly seven words in the word cloud at the end. If there aren't any, if there are more than seven, then somebody messed up. So the link, the links at the top there. For those of you who haven't got it, it's worked for five. Hopefully the people at home. Hello people at home. Hopefully you can also join in here as well. So for those of you just arrived, we've just started with a bit of a bit of a quiz. You've got time to sit down and log in the links at the top there to to post seven words representing the seven prince, two principles. For 18 of you have done that so past half way. It's good. Let's get a few more of you logged on and posting your answers there. I think you got to press submit when you've written it, in case you hadn't realised that. Does anyone finish that yet? Seven. Done. You finished? Because some nods. Shall I stop the poll there? Anybody still desperately trying to write down some answers? Press submit. Then I'm going to stop the poll in just a second. Hopefully. So I'm hoping that will be exactly seven words appearing the word cloud. Let's see if you're if you did it. Okay. Not quite. Not quite seven. Probably about 30. Well done though. Managed by exception. That's certainly one of them. Learn from experience is another one. Tailoring is another one. The business case. That's a good one as well. Managed by products managed by stages. Justification in business. I can see why you put a different word for those. That seems fair enough. Change is one of the themes, not one of the principles. Some people have written full sentences, which is fair enough. Plan by section. Plan by stages. I'm assuming you meaning there? Yeah, those all seem good. I can't see any ridiculous mistakes in there. Yet defined roles and responsibilities here. Good. Looks good to me. Well done everyone. So you've you've understood those principles. Just a reminder. Here they are. Here again. Continuous business justification. That's the big one that stands out. Learn from experience. Defined roles and responsibilities. Managed by stages, managed by exception. Focussed on products and tailored to suit the environment. So let's continue with this quiz. So who on the project board represents? Who is on the project board? Or who is represented by the project board? To be, to be more precise. So you can vote for up to three people here. So it was only on Thursday we did this. So hopefully this is all immediately obvious to you all. Of course, when we did our role plays, there were many more people doing those role plays than there are board members. So some of those people were part of the project team, perhaps, but not necessarily on the board itself. So in Prince two, there are there is a core set of stakeholders who are represented on the board. Who are they is what I'm trying to get at here. So submit your answers please. I'll give you five more seconds to get your answer in. Okay. 28 out of 36, 29. Can we get up to 30? Yes we can. Well done. All right, so we have the business executive. Of course. The executive is the chair of the board. They're the person responsible for the business case making sure that that is upheld. The project manager is not on the project board. They report to the board. They are not on the board. Users are represented. They're represented by the senior user. Customers are not represented, but suppliers are. And there there are possibly stakeholder representatives, but they are not core members of the board. You may choose to add some stakeholders to your board, but they're not part of the core board. So the core board is the the executive the senior user and the senior supplier. Those are the big three. The project manager is not on the board. And that's why this question was asked okay. So this is what it looks like as your board of directors. The management is happening at this level. The directors are at this level. There's a difference in authority there between the project manager and the board. Okay. Starting up a project is triggered by which of the following. The business case, the outline business case, the project charter, the mandate, the project exec, senior management or corporate strategy. So you remember that starting up is the first prince to process. Okay. Get your answers in, then please press submit or whatever you need to do. There we go. Okay. So the majority of you said project mandate and you were correct. The project charter is another name for the project brief. That is the input to the that is given to the board as a result of the starting up phase. So after starting up, you'll produce your outline business case as part of your project Brief. And that's what you'll submit to the board. But the project mandate is the input to the starting up phase. That's the thing that triggers the project in the first place. Okay, good. So there we are. That's a diagram showing the very first prince to document the project mandate. Who knows who wrote that. It's kind of outside of the project. And that's kind of the initial trigger okay. Next question. Which of the following is not an objective of initiating a project. So initiating a project this is the IP the IP process in Prince two I'm talking about which of these is not an objective of it. Okay, I'll stop the poll. Let. Quite a mixture here. Quite a mixture. So quite, quite a lot of you said. Understanding the roles. Not many of you have. So I think most of you agree that scope is certainly something that is fleshed out as part of initiating. So the answer here is the top one because that is already done. That is already done at starting up. Okay. It's not done at initiation. Initiation. Is this sort of the planning stage. That's when you go into detail about managing the scope, managing the quality, managing the details of delivery. But starting up, you will establish who the roles are and define that board. So that's why that was the one that is not part of initiating. Now of course it is part of initiating a PMBoK project. It's just not part of the initiating process in Prince two. That's something you've got to realise. Initiating and starting up are two distinct stages. So there's the start up stage. I'm not sure why I showed you that one was not relevant to this question. Which of the management product is created when the business case is updated during initiating a project? So this is a very tricky question because I didn't teach you this explicitly, but try and work it out by elimination. So which other management product is created when the business case is updated during initiating a project? Okay, let's stop the poll there. Okay. Interesting. Interesting. So the correct answer is the benefits review plan. When the business case is updated. What that means is where? So we started with the outline business case. In starting up, when we move to initiation, we're dealing with fleshing out the business case with more details. When we do that, certain benefits are going to be made may differ. If you change your business case like we did, like we may have had to do in last week's seminar, you will have to change the scope. You will have to change the objectives. Things change right when you if you change the if you change the business case. Right. So everything kind of is based on that business case. It's kind of the first thing you need to be thinking about in Prince too, because everything else follows from it. So that's why that's the answer there. Of course, the initiation plan is actually the plan for how you're going to do initiation. That's something you do during starting up. That's a bit of a trick question there. You will do some planning, of course, a lot of planning during initiating. And there you go. That's the project initiation document. You can see the benefits review plan is there, along with business case and other things that happen during that stage. Okay. When updating the project plan as part of managing a stage boundary, what else might be updated? Go. I think there are two reasonable answers here, but one of them is the right one. Hopefully you can. Deduce which one it is. Okay, I'll stop the poll there. So remember, Princeton is managed by stages. Everything happens in a stage by stage way. It's very iterative in that way. And each at each stage you do the planning for the next stage. And of course you've got that continuous business case review. So the business case is something that will almost certainly be updated. However, it will be updated as part of the project initiation document that is an iteratively updated baseline document. The business case is a chapter of that. It's a part of that. But the whole PID is updated every single stage. So well done to the one person who who worked that one out. If you're very proud of yourself, there he is. The rest of you, yes, of course, the business case will be updated. That's important in Prince, too, so you probably could have provided some justification for that. And there we go. Look, this is the stage boundary. And this is things getting updated each stage. Let's look at the leaderboard. And there we go. No one's on full marks yet. It's interesting. Hopefully you can put your name on there. Okay. Next. So finally a recap of city then. So last week I argued that Prince two is some people would argue that Prince was only suitable for large projects, that there's mountains of paperwork that is bureaucratic. But I put forth a very theoretical case to explain that. Well, actually, Prince two is tailor able and therefore scalable. The paperwork is actually useful. It provides an audit trail. It helps you learn and reduce risks and monitor progress and achieve success. And the bureaucracy is somehow useful for maintaining control. And Prince two is for projects where you need that control. That doesn't mean you need control in every project, and it also doesn't mean that your prince to managers and board need to micromanage, which is what we often think of when we think of bureaucracy. Actually managed by exception tells them that they shouldn't be doing that at all. They should be setting limits. So Prince doesn't have to be this horrific thing that that opponents might think it is. Of course, our guest lecturer came in and perhaps cast some sceptical light on those ideas, questioned the fact that we we need to ask, do we even need the project? You know, using common sense is really important. And perhaps following a methodology to the letter obviates the need for common sense. So maybe it's important to just stop and think, do we even need this methodology at all? Do we even need this project at all? Now, I would argue that actually the Prince do business case is is there for that exact purpose to make sure that common sense prevails. But I'm sure our guest lecturer doesn't know what he's talking about. And in real life, common sense is often lacking on project boards. So yeah, important to know about. Also, is the board right. Having a board does not. Having a board of senior user senior supply executive does not mean that they will be able to deliver for those those different three stakeholders because they may have strong egos or they may have weak authority, unable to deliver something, or they may just be the wrong people, representing the wrong people. They may be a board of it specialists delivering to people who don't understand it, and of course, managing powerful egos. So there are lots of caveats, lots of challenges. Prince two doesn't solve these interpersonal human problems. It provides a framework and some principles that I think are very well, well thought through and very sensible. But in practice, it's very difficult to get the board to work effectively. It's very difficult to get projects to be successful. There are many challenges in making it work. In reality. That doesn't mean the methodology is wrong. Not having these these tools wouldn't make it any less likely to fail. I think you need to realise that it's not a silver bullet though. It doesn't just magically solve these problems. That's that's the key point. Okay, let's see if there's any questions coming in. Before I carry on, what format do you have to write the project initiation assignment in? So the first chapter of the assignment you should make a PDF. You should make it anonymous. All the information is on Moodle and on the, I should say on the web page. The module web page for the benefits document question. Surely risks will also change when you are doing initiation. Maybe risks will be identified, but risks tend to be identified during. Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah you'll identify risks. I think that makes sense. That's also part of the PID I suppose as well. When's the deadline for chapter one? There isn't a hard deadline for chapter one, chapters one and two. Well, I'll talk about the deadlines towards the end. I think that probably makes more sense when I can show you it on a visual diagram. And is there an example we can see? The whole purpose of the peer assessment is that you're going to get to see lots of examples. You're going to get to mark them. You going to get to learn by seeing them. You're going to get to go back and change and improve your essays and produce a better essay at the end. So I think you'll get plenty of opportunity to see things. I think. I don't want to overwhelm you by giving you more, more examples. I think that might just bias you and change your perception of what's good and what's not good. But I will at the end of this session if there's time to walk you through the mark scheme and explain to you how it's going to work. So let me just hide some of these so I can get back on with. Session. And can I explain what I want? I can, I'll very briefly explain that what I'm looking for is an essay that involves evidence informed, critical discussion, reflective thinking based on the case study work you've been doing in seminars. So the work you do in the seminars, you'll probably include it as a figure to support your essay. Figures are not counting towards the word count, so if you produce a nice project brief your objectives might be really smart. You might use produce a table summarising your smart objectives, or you might summarise your best ones or something like that. And that would be a figure which you refer to where you can critically evaluate your smart objectives. That might be something you talk about. That's just one of many possible things you can talk about. It's an essay. Therefore you can choose the direction you go in. You've got to try and pick a sensible approach to that essay to make it persuasive to your peers. So hopefully that explains that the information is all on the module web page, as I said. So I will I will allow you to read that at your leisure. But we'll also come back to talk about this at the end, because today I want to get on with budgeting and forecasting. So first of all then what is budgeting. How do we create a budget? How do we estimate costs and do it reliably. And we're going to do a little activity to figure out how to build autonomous cars. Hopefully you're good at estimating to do that. So let's start with that. So what's a budget. It's just an estimate right. It's just an idea of how much things are going to cost. Maybe maybe what the revenues are going to be. What the resources are needed is kind of just defining those constraints on a project, usually over a specified period. Budget is also a verb. It's the act of planning expenditure, of allocating resources. We all know that budgets can be can be quite, quite unreliable. But where do we see this fitting into the PMBoK PMI approach? Budgeting is in within planning and cost management. We've got here. We've got this bit here right. Cost planning and cost. Um, so very similar to when we talk about scope management and time management, the very first thing we do is we plan cost management. That's the meta bit where we plan the planning. We figure out how we're going to do cost management. We decide which methods we're going to use, and then the steps that we invariably are going to have to go see. What are things like estimating costs, determining the overall budget, putting it into some kind of Gantt chart like thing, like sort of a cost baseline we call it. And then the activity, the main thing we're going to do during the project is try and control those costs when things go wrong, when things go outside of a certain threshold, you might need to then act and do something about it. Maybe change the project, change the timeline, change the scope, figure out some way of managing those costs. So again, nothing so complicated in the PMBoK guide, but let's just have a look at what creating a project project budget usually involves. So as inputs it's going to take in things like the plan the project management plan. That's the plan for how we're managing the project. The project chargeable brief the the thing outlining in detail what we're going to be, what our constraints are in the project and any kind of environmental factors or organisational assets, things that are kind of part of every project within an organisation. So no specific inputs. The main outputs of the budget process are a cost management plan that tells us how we're going to manage variations in costs, the activity estimates and the cost baseline as I said. So these three things one, two and three, I've kind of made these little purple circles. I'm going to refer to them today. We'll go through talking about each of these different things. So the first one of course how do we do that. Cost management. When you're managing costs in an organisation, you need to be aware of the fact that the organisation doesn't have an infinite budget to spend on your project. If you are overrun by 500%, that money has to come from somewhere. So usually this is where you are at the project level. You estimate your costs and you probably add a bit of a contingency there. If you think I'm going to probably buy some software to do my project, our budget £10, but actually I'm not certain. So you'll add a little sort of contingency reserve. You'll sort of slightly overestimate to account for the uncertainty. And then when you sort of build your whole work package, you might say, right, the whole work package cost about this. Let's add a bit of a contingency there as well, just as a buffer, a bit of overflow in case we run out of money. And then of course this produces overall for the whole project a cost baseline. This is the the overall budget. And then the management reserve will add some some reserve to account for perhaps unidentified risks. How are you going to manage them? Things that the PM can't manage within their thresholds tends to be sort of a fixed percentage for all projects, based on the organisation's risk appetite. If they've got lots of spare cash, then maybe they can be more generous there. If they can't, they might be more strict. And that's how you come up with your overall project budget. But then, of course, you want to make a profit from your project as well. So maybe you'll add that to that pricing. That's how you finally work out the overall price of the project. You know, there's a lot of this stuff. The actual costs are very low compared to the final amount that you charge your customer, because there is going to be a lot of uncertainty. Things will go wrong. Projects are inevitably full of that uncertainty. So uncertainty is an important factor when it comes to to managing budgets, just like with time management that we already talked about. Okay. So that's that's kind of the main idea, but how do we actually do the activity estimation that the core part of this is about estimating activities. And that's something that is inherently hard. So what you try and do is come up with rules of thumb or strategies for estimating reliably. So one way of doing this is to try to reduce the information that you already have into more simplified things like a cost per x, like a cost per unit time, or a cost per use, or a cost per brick or a cost per developer hour, that kind of thing. And then you can use these rules of thumb to calculate your overall estimates from that. So that's that's a relatively simple way of doing it. There are some other ways to do that. You can use a method called analogous estimation. What you basically do is say, well, we did a project like this last week and it cost £3,000. So I'm going to estimate £3,000 again. Or you might say this one is twice as big. So we'll we'll double it. Parametric is the same as analogous. But you sort of try to parameterise some of the things. So you might decide to sort of come up with a very rudimentary parametric model for how is this the number of windows might determine the overall cost of a house. If it's got four windows, it might cost £100,000. If it's got eight, it might cost therefore £200,000. That kind of rule of thumb or parametric method, I should say it's not a rule of thumb. It's a it's a numerical method to to try to calculate something, a good way of getting more accurate estimates, because project managers don't necessarily know how much things cost is by asking the people doing the work. They're the ones who will tell you how long it's going to take. They're the one who will tell you what, what kind of you haven't thought of yet. We need to buy this software. We need to buy this license. Oh, okay. I didn't realise that. Therefore, how much do you think it will cost? They'll tell you. So asking the team is much more reliable than just the project manager making those decisions. Also, another, another variant of team based estimation is to is to sort of crowdsource. So you ask ten people how much it's going to cost rather than asking one. And what that does is that factors in everyone's uncertainty. So if some people have a good grasp of the of the risk or think there's some uncertainty, then they're going to go for bigger numbers. So you can get a gauge of things if you ask more people. So crowdsourcing is a very good way of collecting knowledge collectively. There's a method called three point estimation. In three point estimation, rather than just estimating one number, you estimate a min and a max as well. We already talked about this this previously when we talked about the Pert method for time estimation. It's the same here. In fact this slide is probably identical to the slide I presented a few weeks ago when I talked about time management. Because the methods for estimating activity durations is very similar to the methods for estimating activity costs. And as I said last time, it's also useful to have that measure of uncertainty. I'm a few extra things for activity cost estimation. You could do vendor bids. I think our guest lecturer last week talked about how the vendor bidding process works. You can get bids from many people. They can also how much they're prepared to do the work for. And you use that as a way of estimating the cost. You might pick the average or the biggest of those numbers to decide how much things are worth. We need to remember is when you're choosing an option, you don't. You shouldn't always just use the cheapest option. It's not always the most optimum approach. What you need to calculate is the cost of quality, which means you've got to think about the failure rates and the cost of having to go back to the drawing board and buy something again in three weeks time. If you buy a really cheap bicycle, it might last you a month. If you buy a really good bicycle, it might cost you five times as much, but it might last you ten times as long. Or maybe it will only last you twice as long, in which case it wasn't the right decision. So you need to make a decision based on on those kind of things. We'll come back and talk about decision tree analysis later on. So I'm not going to labour that point anymore. But it's an important method and something you should be aware of. Okay. So now let's now that I've rambled on, let's try and put some of these ideas into practice. I want to prove to you that estimation is hard, but I'm going to try and give you some ideas of how to improve upon it. So I just thought the day you'd be interested to build a self driving taxi business, I was reading some news about a particular company whose self driving taxi decided to run someone over, and I thought that didn't sound so great. But is there why? Why are companies investing so many billions of pounds in self driving taxis? Is there money in this business? So I did a few calculations, and this is the kind of thing that a budgeting person might need to do, right? If you were to lease a very expensive car, like a top of the range car, then you might be spending up to say £2,000 a month. I imagine most cars are, you know, 10% of that to lease. Right. So we're talking you know, I'm going I'm overestimating this number. I'm deliberately picking a big number that's kind of, you know, the most expensive car you could possibly lease £2,000 a month. Right. And how much would the fuel cost for this taxi, let's say £1,000 a month? I've calculated that by thinking an electric vehicle on average gets about three miles per kilowatt hour electricity, my current tariff at home is 30 per kilowatt hour. That means I'm paying ten fee per mile. If the taxi is driving at 25mph for 50% of the day. Remember, this is an autonomous taxi, right? It's going to be just driving constantly. So let's say it's driving over 50% of the day, probably 100%. Right? But let's be conservative then. It's probably doing about 300 miles per day. That's about £30 a day or £1,000 a month. So my fuel costs thousand pounds a month. Right. You understand the logic of these calculations? They're quite simple to work out, but it's just kind of common sense calculations. Right. And how much money would we make from this service? Well, let's say 10,000 minutes of paid journeys per month. Why have I thought that? Well, I'm assuming there are. Well, I know there are 43,800 minutes in a month. And I'm assuming that if it's driving 50% of the time, only 25% of the time is it taking journeys. The rest of the time it's sort of going to the next customer. So half of the time it's driving, it's it's taking a paid fare, the other time it's not. So that's about 10,000 minutes of cab fares. So we're talking £3,000 per hour costs 10,000 minutes. That's £0.30 per minute is how much money it would it would cost us to run this business. So if we charge our customers more than £0.30 a minute, then we're making profit. If you got an Uber now with a human driver, you pay about a pound a minute on average. So there's a big, big scope for profit, right? We could charge up to a pound. If we charge £0.99, we're cheaper than Uber and we're making £0.59 of profit per minute for not for no human involvement right there. Self driving car. So you could buy a hundred of these things set them all going. You know this is like huge huge money right. You could make with this. It's basically you can print print your own money if you buy one of these self-driving taxis. So that's why it's big money. So that was an example of how you can do some calculations. Now I want you to do a few calculations in your heads. We're not going to have time to do a to do it accurately. So you're going to have to sort of just go with the best guess. But imagine you were asked to build an autonomous taxi service. How much would it cost you to get up and running? So what's your initial guess if you were to start your very own business now, I realise I've given you no information on which to base this decision. So how much is the R&D going to cost? How much do you think? So the poll is open. I'll give you 20s to think of an answer. The link is the same as ever before. So what's your initial R&D expenditure for this self driving taxi business that you're going to start? Don't worry, we'll improve this estimate over time, so I don't expect you to get it right. Some people panic when you give them an impossible question, but I'm just trying to get a ballpark figure. I'm crowdsourcing the answer, you see. So yeah, the answer is in millions. So if you think it's going to be 1 million, then put one. Of course, if you think it's going to be 50 million, then put 50, etcetera. Okay, I'll give you a few more seconds to press submit. Okay. Stop it there. See the initial guess? Let's see what you've put. Maybe I won't show you. I won't show you. We'll come back to that in a second. Right? I want you to chat to someone near you and then revise your estimate. So chat to a neighbour or someone on a nearby row. Ask them what they've gone for. Maybe adjust your estimate, discuss why they've gone from. Maybe you've got like a minute to make it. Have a chat. So go ahead and then I'll open the poll.

UNKNOWN
Which we can live by. Guessing on how many engineers you can eat. Pay them. How much. And that gets to about five years plus.

SPEAKER 0
Sounds reasonable. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I would say. Yeah, I think that's sensible. I was thinking a lot of the research might have already been done. You can maybe just buy the research because Google have been doing this in 2013. Might not be as expensive as you might have thought. Oh, there you go. We've had a conversation. Okay. Is everyone had a conversation with their neighbour? I'll allow you now to put your revised estimate into the system. So my hypothesis here is that this is going to narrow the standard deviation. It's going to reduce the variation in responses because you've consolidated your knowledge collectively. It's kind of the same principle as peer assessment. Okay. I'll wait till we get to 31. Give it a couple more seconds. I think 32. Excellent. Okay, good. Stop the poll there. So, do I show you the answers yet? Okay, now I'm going to show you both sets of answers together. Here we are. So before speaking to your neighbour, how do I understand this graph? I don't understand the graph at all. Okay, so some people up at the extreme here saying it was going to be a thousand million, £1 billion. Some people were kind of at the very low end. So I guess not a lot of granularity here, but I guess before people were kind of had a smaller number in mind and they've kind of maybe increased it slightly. So these things are moving this way maybe Ken, understand this graph. I was hoping. I was hoping it looked like a beautiful sort of bell curve. It didn't didn't quite play out in my mind. Let me go back to the previous slide and see if I can look at the real answers. Whoops. Okay. So let me go. So the average before was 281 million. And the average after was 295 million. So there wasn't actually that big a difference between the two.

UNKNOWN
Um function five. Apologies.

SPEAKER 0
Technology issues again decided to go for dual screen. Okay, so while it's loading, I'll explain to you. So I know the likes of Waymo. They invested they've invested billions of pounds in this kind of technology. In fact it's about it's about to show you the slide now. I hope. There we go. Okay. So yeah, Waymo or you know the Google owned version, they spent 1.1 billion on their R&D between 2010 and 2015. So you know those who said a thousand million, a billion at the far, far end of the graph, maybe there's some truth to that. I know that crews who recently had have been had their license removed in San Francisco for running someone over. They spend about 2 billion a year on on their self-driving car project. So humongous amount of money. Amazon. They bought a company called Zoox in 2020 for 1.2 billion. So we are talking in the billions, the R&D. But in my view the R&D price is kind of the money's already been spent. Now I think the knowledge is now there. So if you tried to buy a lidar sensor intended for 50, it was £75,000 for a single lidar sensor, right? They're now £100. In 2020 they were £100, right? And recently Elon Musk said lidar sensors even these that just use cameras. Right. So he thinks it's a fool's errand to even bother, even to have bothered spending the hundreds of millions of pounds developing lidar sensor technology to the standard. It's out today, so the research and development is already fully mature now. I think we're now at a stage where we actually have the components and ingredients we need to produce our self-driving cars, so I don't think the R&D thing matters. So let's forget about the R&D that's done. You're going to buy the components, all of it already pre-made. You have to develop the software, of course, but the you can buy the sensors for relatively cheap now. So we're now going to sort of talk about more specific. So let's say you're going to buy 100 self-driving autonomous vehicles to build your autonomous taxi service. So how much will it cost to build them? That's my my next question for you. So for for your benefit. We're talking to millions here. If you think it's going to be £1 million per car, then it will cost you 100 million to make 100 cars. Hopefully that makes sense. Might be easy to think of it per car as opposed to the big number. But yeah, give your answer between 0 and 200 million for the for this project. So what we're trying to do here, we try to narrow down narrow down the the answers to a more specific figure by thinking a bit more about how it's going to work. So again, this is this is still quite an arbitrary thing. You were not estimating the R&D, which was completely unknown. We now thinking about the the build cost. So wait till you get your answer in. We're going to try and refine this estimate as we as we go through again. Okay, so this time the average is 50 million. So it's going to cost us on average about £500,000 per car. That sounds reasonably sensible. So this is kind of the the mean here. Quite a few think it's much less ten of you think it's less than £100,000 per car. So you already think it's into the viable territory of affordable consumer things. We're talking fully self driving autonomous taxi service here. So that's pretty exciting. If that's if that's the case. Two people have gone for it costing £2 million per car, much more expensive. So there's a very big spread here. I think that's the key message here. But 5050 sorry. Go back. Can I go back? Yes. So £500,000 per car. That is the current average. Okay. So now I want you to estimate the minimum. What's the minimum it would cost to build 100 cars. So what we're trying to do now is quantify the uncertainty. We're going to go for a three point estimate. I'm going to ask you for the minimum and the maximum. And I want to see if those numbers help to bound our answer. So think about what you said last time and just try to decide what the minimum would be. This comes back to the point of it being important to quantify uncertainty. And if you do quantify uncertainty, it should make you more reliable in your estimations. Okay. Oh, wait a few more seconds for the last few people to get their answer in. Excellent. So whereas the whereas the mean was 50,000. If it was 500,000 per car, we're now going for as little as I think. Yeah, 180,000 per car. Okay. Or 18 million for the project. So we've gone from here being the average to being more like here. So quite a big spread, quite a big variation there. And secondly then what's the maximum to build a fleet of 100 cars. Hopefully you can answer this one relatively easily. Okay. Get your answer in for the last couple of people. Someone's not submit yet.

UNKNOWN
Here we go. Okay.

SPEAKER 0
Okay. So a very big range here. So now we've kind of we're doubling right. So we more than halved it for our minimum. We've doubled our our average now for the for the maximum. So very very big spread. So it's important that you have quantified that that that uncertainty. And you can see that the maximums are very widely ranging. Some people still think the maximum is less than £100,000 per car, which is interesting. Those people obviously have a very different perception of the cost of things to it than others. Okay, so let's summarise those three sets of results at the same time. Can I do that? Yes I can. I'm not sure if this graph is useful at all, but it shows that the minimum is sort of very bunched up at this end. The mean is kind of still quite a bunch of descent, but has a long tail, and then the max is kind of a long flat distribution across across all the values. Probably means we have no idea. I think it's the is the main conclusion from that. Okay. So it's very hard to estimate that because you don't know anything about building cars. I understand that you're not in the engineering school. So what I thought I do is I asked ChatGPT, how do you build a car? What it did was it gave me a work breakdown structure that looks like this, components being things like production planning, vehicle hardware and sensors, software development, connectivity testing, regulatory compliance, fleet deployment, ChatGPT knows everything. It knows exactly how to build a self-driving taxi already, which is pretty cool. So if we now think in terms of work packages, maybe we're going to be more accurate. Maybe if we if we component wise, do the estimates and then bring it back together, my hope is that you'd be more accurate at your estimate. So two of the two of the work packages are to do with development costs, software development and connectivity. So things like how do you deal with these sensors, the cameras or lidar sensors, how do you do mapping and getting from A to B? Probably just, you know, import Google Maps or something. How do you do control and planning and things like that. How do you make a user interface? These things all seem like things that you're already doing in your third year project, so you probably have a good idea of how long they're going to take connectivity. Maybe the vehicles are going to communicate with each other or with infrastructure that you're going to have to build or with the internet. So they're going to be sort of development costs there. So can you estimate the development costs? These aren't the manufacturing costs. These are the development costs for the software needed to implement your fleet of 100 cars. So I'll open the poll. So what we've now done is we've tried to break down the problem into manageable chunks. An estimation should be easier. When we've done that, our uncertainty should reduce. If we can trust ChatGPT. Which of course we can be using it for our dissertations, aren't we?

UNKNOWN
I hope not.

SPEAKER 0
Okay. Still waiting for some answers. Get your answer in. Okay, I'll stop the poll there. So how much you think it will cost to develop the software? Nice and small numbers. Okay. The average is £10 million in total. That works out about £100,000 per car. So that explains why there was a significant number of you all thought it would cost more than £100,000 per car to actually build it, because surely the development cost would also have to be part of that, right? But this is a much more tightly bunched set of numbers, right? Some people have gone up this end, which is fair enough, but the range is much narrower. And I think that suggests that you're better at estimating things like software development because you have some experience and knowledge of that. So that's useful. Oops, I've gone the wrong direction. Next management costs. So these are things that perhaps you don't have much experience of. But maybe you have an idea of how much they should cost. Things like how much will it cost you initiate the project, such as producing a project brief, identifying stakeholders, doing things like planning, resource management. How much is that going to cost in million? Now you can think of it per car, but it might be better just to think of it as how many members of staff are you going to employ as managers? How long is the project going to go on for? Therefore, how much is it going to cost? That might be one way of thinking about it. So I feel like these are much easier to estimate. Is that agreed to people feel the same. These aren't too tricky to think about. So once you've got your WBS, budgeting becomes easier. Maybe. Did it become more accurate, though? We'll find out at the end. Okay, so the last couple of people need to get their votes in. How much does the management cost? Okay, I'll stop the poll there. Okay, so we've got lots and lots of. We think management's cheap. I'm sure it is. Just hire some some students from the business school. We can get all the management done for kind of around 5 million. So that sounds pretty good. So that's not a big cost. I would agree with that one. Okay. So next kind of illegal stuff the testing of the cars the safety and compliance costs. How much is that going to cost. You're going to test in simulation first and then do a few kind of racetrack tests and then finally get them on the real roads. And of course, you've got to make sure you're complying with different regulations and doing other things. So you probably need some lawyers to make sure that's all going above board. They're probably a little bit expensive, but not hugely so. Question over there are some of these things will probably be part of the R&D. Let's assume all of the components have been developed, but the actual car itself has never been tested in your software needs to be tested, right? Okay. No going down. That's not a good sign. People are amending their answer. That's fair enough. Okay. When it gets to 31, I'll stop the poll. So somebody submit. There we go. Thank you. Okay. How much? How much is going to cost? I think this is probably quite expensive. And, yeah, we're a bit uncertain. We don't really know much about this area. And and lo and behold, we've got a nice broad spread. So the average here is 25 million for the overall deployment costs. I think in reality it's probably much bigger than that. But I think I didn't give you a big range. But yeah. There we go. Good. Okay. And finally then the bit that is kind of the hardware bit making the cars the, you know, procuring the sensors, installing them. You're going to retrofit a vehicle that's part of the cheapest route. So how much is it gonna cost you to install those sensors on there and install your software and your user interface for the people to use it as a taxi? And perhaps also the maintenance by setting up service centres and things like that. There's probably additional stuff that you might also want to think about. So how much is that going to cost for this full thing? You know, if I ask this ten years ago, the numbers would be monumentally high. Now that some of the components are now much cheaper, maybe this isn't as expensive as it was before. Okay, that's a few answers in then. All right, stop all that. Good. Let's see what you think. So I think I see. So there's still quite a bit of uncertainty here. The average here is 2020 million in total. That's £200,000 per car. So. You know, some people think it's going to be really cheap. Some people think it's only going to be, you know, £10,000 per car to install the sensors because they're thinking, just plug the Lada and stick an iPad in there. That's all you need, right? Other people think it's more complicated. Maybe. Maybe they're building a more expensive vehicle. Maybe the scope wasn't clear enough. And maybe that's why there's a big spread here. Or maybe you just don't know how much things cost. That's also possible. Um, let me give you some answers, if that's possible. So this is how much I think. Um, I think it was. This. Was this Waymo's estimate? I can't remember whose estimate. This one is at the top, but back when light sensors cost £100,000 each, there was an estimate that it would cost about quarter of a million per car. Waymo in 2021 said they are aiming to get the cars on the road for £150,000 per car. Another analysis in 2023 said £100,000 of car and people are aiming for this number £30,000 per car of the same price as an ordinary car by 2030, maybe more likely 2040, because I think there's an issue of getting these things approved by different regulators. I mean, they're driving around San Francisco right now causing all kinds of mayhem. Still far better safety record than human beings. But that's not good enough for people. People want them to be. You know, I think people would rather be as bad as human beings then than be sort of autonomous vehicles. There's a problem when people don't embrace technology. So I think, you know, will it get to this point? I don't know when will it get to this point? I think it's more the question. But, you know, big, big range of big spread of values. So I think yeah. So what did you say before? Let's just remind ourselves of what you said your initial estimates were between. So we're about £500,000 because your your budgets were way bigger than, than estimated. Your minimum was was around this mark wasn't it. So your minimum was kind of close to what they currently estimated at. So maybe maybe that's reasonable. The people at this end, you know, you were far, too far too cautious in your estimation. But I think that's what happens with this uncertainty. So big, big spread. So we weren't that accurate when you revised your estimate. This is when we. So this is the combined this is the combined total of all the different answers that you gave. So the average was was 10 million, which I think is here which is about £100,000 per car. Is that right?

SPEAKER 1
I know something's not right there.

SPEAKER 0
No, I think. Yeah, I think I think I'm going to multiply that by four because it's, it's actually the average not the total. So your average was 40, which is here about £400,000 per car. Whereas actually the current estimate by the likes of Waymo is a quarter of that. So we weren't that accurate I guess. I guess that's what we learned. I think that's the the bottom line here. So so what what have we learned. Let's try and consolidate and find some lessons from this from this this exercise. Okay. Did team estimation chatting to your neighbour improve your accuracy? I don't think it necessarily did, but it probably narrowed your it narrowed your uncertainty interval. It made you more certain in the number you'd gone for or allowed you to adjust your number. So there was something gained from that. Maybe the three point estimation your the real answer was within the range of your min and max. However your minimax was huge. So it was useful to quantify that uncertainty. And it showed that the sort of the collective knowledge of the classroom did correctly identify the bounds. However, you kind of were way over on your average under your max numbers. I think it's true that the work breakdowns director our accuracy that I think there was it certainly felt more reliable. The final number was less. So there was definitely an improvement. By using the work breakdown structure. It didn't improve it nearly enough, but maybe with more iteration there would, I think, the real conclusion. I wrote this slide, of course, before I knew what you'd done, but I kind of knew what was going to happen. We do. We know what we don't know. I think I think we don't know what we don't know. And that's the problem. It's very, very hard to estimate values and uncertainty. There was no real convergence on the true answer by crowdsourcing. I don't think we just we just didn't have the right information. People are generally rubbish estimating. I think that's that's the truth. And that's something that it's important to get better at. And that comes with experience and with doing some research and doing some homework. In real life, you wouldn't have to decide in a classroom with no information. You'd probably Google it. You probably ask chat GPT the answer is probably out there somewhere, so you might get better by using methods like that. However, I think your answer was within the range of the normal cone of uncertainty, which is good. So the cone of uncertainty tells us that at the start of a project, we can be about 400% out on average. Most of the time when you estimate a project at the start, you're 400% out within the range of a 3:45 times the true value. Okay, this is this one. Here is the true value. The true cost it's going to have. You're between you know, this huge range 400% range. So we're very uncertain at the start of a project. And then as the project commences as we gather knowledge and information, the cone narrows. We get more and more certain about the true value, because we've kind of we've learned something, we've understood something. And of course, the mission is to narrow this cone as quickly as possible. So how do we do that? Well, we do things like planning, right? So we have a specification. We try to figure out what the constraints and risks are. We try to understand what the variables are. We try and do some research or we start developing. We start implementing working code and actually learning in real life. So you narrow the cone in two different ways. You either narrow it by planning, by clarifying the definitions, or you narrow it by iterating and learning from feedback. There's are two different philosophies for how we narrow the cone of uncertainty the Prince two approach or the agile approach. I suppose you could call them two different ways. You don't have to pick one. You can pick both, but that's that's key. You've got to narrow that cone. If you want a project to finish within a certain cost, a certain amount, or finish within a certain time frame. Okay, I think it might be good time for a five minute break, and I'll do questions after the break. So if you want to come back at 4:05, we will resume by doing some some hard maths and learning about earned value analysis.

UNKNOWN
See you soon! Well, that's. Hello.

SPEAKER 2
Question on being able to attend this week's seminar. Okay, teacher, but should I submit the worksheet before the seminar or how should I go about.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, it won't be marked. I'll turn the microphone off. Yes. No. We'll post the solutions online so you can just do it remotely. Okay. So email me or one of the tutors okay. And tell us that, you know it was the reason for absence so we can put it as an authorised absence. Okay. But otherwise you can do this questions online there on Moodle.

UNKNOWN
Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Oh. Oh, yeah. This is more. Here. Thank you sir. All. One. Yes. She's not. I was. That. Oh. You. Because I feel.

SPEAKER 0
Okay, so I'll make a I'll make a start. I've got a couple of questions. Someone asked what the contingency reserve is again. That is the the buffer. The kind of we make a budget of £100 or £1000. And we have a contingency reserve, which is kind of our, our backup in case we overspend. So maybe it's 10%. We choose a number that allows us to kind of go over budget a little bit, so we don't have to sort of speak to our boss and say, oh, sorry, I'm 30 over budget. Is it okay you need that contingency reserve to sort of just save everyone a lot of headache. Can I explain vendor bids and cost of poor quality again, please? I don't have time to do that. But in quick terms, the idea of vendor bids is that you ask a bunch of vendors, not vendors, vendors, to to, to quote, how much they think it's going to cost. And you collate that information and pick your preferred vendor based on their offer. So you're just asking experts to quote you and using that information. Cost of poor quality is about making a decision by thinking about the probabilities of certain things, such as having to go back to the shop and buy another thing. So if, for example, with the bicycle example I gave, if you buy a cheap bike, you'll have to buy a new one every year. If you buy a very expensive bike, it might last you longer. Therefore, the overall amortised cost over the lifetime of that vehicle is is what you need to think about, not the initial one off cheap deal that you think is a good, good price to pay. Hopefully that explains those two things. So let us go back to the boring lecture material. We're going to do some some maths now, which is going to be exciting for you all. Hopefully I haven't bored you too much in the first half there. So we're going to talk. So we've talked so far about budgeting. We now have a pretty shoddy budget because we know how inaccurate we are estimating. What we now want to do is use it. We want to monitor things. We want to check that the budget is going to plan so that we can do some cool stuff. So let's start by talking about cash flow. Cash is needed to buy stuff. That's what we need to do as a business. We need to buy some stuff so we can turn products, create products from. We can't just create it from nothing, right? We need some some cash input to make that happen. But cash is not always as liquid as you might think, right? Companies don't just have a big credit card with £1 billion of credit on it. You know, they they need to manage their cash. They need to manage it more carefully than perhaps than perhaps students do. It's not just about knowing how much you've got, but also when is that money coming in? If you've got ten projects all starting exactly the same time, you're going to have a sudden surge in costs. Maybe your business or maybe your your account balance sheet can't absorb that cost. So you need to make sure you move money around in the right way. So that's why businesses have certain invoice periods so they can manage things. They have things like staggered funds. They have slack in the schedule. Cash needs to be scheduled. Basically, just like any resource, you need to schedule money and where it flows so that you can stay afloat. Okay. So let's have a think about how a typical project might look during a project. Each activity costs maybe at the start of the project would be quite small because the activities are things like planning. As the project gets underway and you've got lots of developers doing lots of cool stuff and buying lots of things, then it becomes expensive and you tend to get a peak and it comes back down towards the end of the project as you're wrapping things up. Okay, this is the typical bell curve. It's normal for a project to follow this kind of smooth curve like this. Okay. So you can probably anticipate this in any given project. And you can make sure that your projects are staggered, so that this does not mean that all projects are spiking at once over the whole organisation. You'll manage your programme of projects and that's how you'll need to manage your cash flow. You may need to reschedule your project if all of the expensive things are happening at the same time, you might say, oh, let's do that expensive procurement this week when we haven't got so much going on, so you might need to manage your money. That way you can turn that previous curve, that bell curve, into a cumulative curve just like this. This is the cumulative cost of activities over the course of the project. And as you probably know from any basic statistics, when you get the cumulative distribution of a bell curve, you get an S curve. The slope increases the expensive part and then it flattens off again towards the end. Hopefully that's intuitive to you. It just it's literally just a cumulative plot of the previous one. But this this is the plot that we use a lot in project management because it's called the performance measurement baseline. It is essentially the plan of value over the lifetime of the project. It's very useful because this terminal number here is the total budget for the project. The sum total of all the activities is the final budget, right. Ignoring contingency reserves of course. So £170,000 is the final budget for this project. So that's that's useful to know. And of course if one of these things changed that, if that went up to 65, then the whole curve would shift up and you'd very quickly be able to see the knock on effects on your cash flow for the rest of the project. So this is a useful curve because it's a it's a curve against which we can measure actual performance, compare our real costs and figure out what's going on. So for example, at a particular point in time you can say, oh, what's the planned expenditure in week week five and a half? I don't know why I picked to put it there in week five and a half. The planned expenditure is about £120,000. It's quite useful. Right? So we call this thing the planned value. The planned value is essentially looking up on this, this value curve, this how much we should have spent by a particular point in time, how much we planned to spend by that particular point in time, or another way of thinking about it. How much should we assign in our budget to the project at that point in time? Right. This is kind of the plan. This is the thing that we designed upfront. I'm stressing that because that's different to the actual cost, which is how much we spent at a particular point in time. That's pretty obvious. You know, you can calculate that by just adding up your bank balance and see what's going on. You look at what things cost. So if you looked at these curves, you can see that we're kind of not spending as much as we thought we would. So what does that tell us? Does that tell us that we're under budget or that we're running late and we just haven't started yet? It could be that this curve is going to go right up there. We don't know what it's going to do. Right. So on its own, the planned value, the budget and the actual expenditure don't tell us a lot about the reasons why that's the cost that we've got. So they give us limited information. It's not that useful. It's a bit useful but not that useful. What instead we can do is calculate something called the earned value. Now this concept is pretty important. So I want to make sure you've understood this one. So what we want is a measure that lets us compare the budget to the work actually done. So when you do work, so let's say your task is to do some software development. And let's say it was budgeted to cost £100. Then when you've done that work you've earned £100 of value for the organisation. So when you've done the work, you have earned the value for which it was budgeted. And what you've done is you've by saying that you've actually combined the cost and the completion of the task into a sort of a single number. Okay. So a way of stating this earned value thing is that the earned value is how much of the planned value has been achieved by doing the work so far. Does that make sense? Um, there's an important reason why we do this, but it's a bit confusing. Yes. But. Can I spend again? Yes I can. So we've got the planned value. That's the budget. That's how much we plan to spend. So at this point in time here, we plan to spend £100,000. This blue, this blue curve here. In reality, we've only spent £35,000. So we're spending a lot less than we had planned to. Right. This earned value curve tells us that we're actually earning a lot of value. That means we're actually getting on with the work. If we've earned £130,000, we've actually done the work up to about this point. We've already done the work packages that would have cost £130,000, and we've done it by only spending £35,000 in the process. So we're actually really doing well with this project. We're ahead of schedule. So we've encoded schedule within within the costs curves. And that's really useful because it gives us that valuable extra bit of information about the schedule.

UNKNOWN
That will be.

SPEAKER 0
Yes, we we evaluate the value of the work we've done. By far, the value of the work we've done by far is how much we budgeted it would cost. So it doesn't matter what the true value is, what matters is how much did we budget it to cost? So when we've done £130,000 of work, we have done all of these activities up to this point here. We've done all the activities on that we had planned to do, but we've done more than the activities we plan to do, basically. So the estimation is the budget. The only estimate we use is the budgeted estimate. Hopefully that makes sense. Okay. So it's the earned value. Is that how much of the planned value has been achieved by doing the value by doing the work? Yes, certainly. Yeah, we've achieved more work because we've earned more value. We've done more work. That's by doing work. We earn value by we by spending money, we accrue actual costs. But by doing the work, we earn the value of that. Okay, hopefully that's clear. I think it's important that we that we make that clear because the rest of what we're going to do today is going to be based on these concepts. So we've got this performance measurement baseline. This is the S-curve that we talked about. Right. And the budget for completion is the total final value, the terminal value of that S-curve and a particular point in time we have the planned value. That's the budget the actual cost and the earned value. And using those three curves we can do quite a lot of stuff okay. Um, as I already mentioned, the S-curve and how it reflects the phase of the project, the initiate, the plan, the execute, and the close. At the beginning of the project, we're doing a lot of planning. It's not very expensive. During the middle of the project, we're doing a lot of work. It's very expensive. Towards the end, we're closing. It's not as expensive again. That's why we have the shape. Okay. So this is something directly from the PMBoK guide, which is why I've kind of pointed this. I mentioned this earlier. As I said, I'd remind you that we're going to be covering all of the different things in the guide. So this is an important and important thing to have. Okay. So just a recap plan value. It's the budget. At any point in time the budget of completion is the total planned value, the final planned value, the value at the end of the project. The actual cost is what we actually spent in the earned value. Is the value of the work completed. How much work we've done. So earned value is an indicator of progress as opposed to an indicator of money. But it's written as a cost. It's got a pound sign next to it. Right. It's it's measured in units of money even though it's a measure of progress. So that allows us to compare the numbers directly. And that's why this method is powerful. And you can you can stick these things in your Gantt charts. And your Gantt charts can do things like forecasting and all sorts of things. See how it's measuring the charts, measuring progress. And you can see the earned value curves and things like that. I don't know which tool this is in particular, but it can be useful, I think, to have this information visible. So let's start talking about earned value analysis okay. So this is kind of the cheat sheet that tells you all the different formula that you need. These are all incredibly simple formulae. Um. So what these variables give you are an instantaneous picture of the project at any point in time. So you've got the budgeted completion. That's the total final budget. You've got the planned value, the actual cost and the earned value that we've already talked about. Planned value is just how much work we had planned to do, the percentage of the work scheduled. Perhaps if you're dealing in that granularity, there are many ways to calculate this, but one way is to look at how much work we've done as a percentage of how much we'd plan to do multiply it by the budget. Compared to the earned value, which is how much we've actually done. Times by the total budget. Does that make sense though? How much we plan to do by the final budget is our planned value at any point in time, the amount we've actually done times by the final budget is how much we've earned by that point in time. So that's a very simplified way of thinking about it. If you have more specific granularity, like each work package might have its own value, then you probably want to add them up and use that information. But if you've got very crude numbers, then this is a simple way of doing it. The actual cost. Obviously you just measured that from your bank balance, and from that we can calculate some simple metrics so we can calculate schedule and cost variance. That's telling us how far. How far we are from the end value. So for example, schedule variance is the earned value minus the planned value. That tells us how much more we've earned than we had planned. That tells us if we're ahead of schedule. So if we've earned a lot of value, this is positive, right? This is we've earned more money. We're sorry. We've earned more value than we had planned to. We've done more work than we had planned. Contrastingly, if the earned value is bigger than the actual amount spent, then we have earned more than it cost. So we're operating cost effectively. Does that make sense? So very simple. And similarly instead of just calculate the difference you can calculate the ratio of these numbers. And we call that an index of efficiency. That is things like. So the schedule performance index is the same as the schedule variance. It's just a rate of earning value compared to planned value. So if we're working at a rate of if we're earning twice as much value for every unit of planned value, we're working twice as quickly. So if that would make SPI equal to two, if we're spending money twice as quickly as we're earning it as the value that we're earning, then we're very inefficient, right? We'd have a 0.5 cost performance index because we're we're not earning as much value as we would have liked. So this would mean a C was twice as big as EV. Right. So this is like an index if it's one we're working at the planned efficiency. If it's bigger than one, then we're working efficiently. If it's less than one, we're working inefficiently. Efficiency in terms of cost efficiency or schedule efficiency, two different efficiencies. You can even combine those two final metrics into an overall efficiency that combines cost and schedule. Because of course, with the iron triangle, we can we can trade off cost and time. If we're behind schedule, we can just pay more people to do the work. We can trade these things off. Okay. So that's the cheat sheet. So let's. Let's give you a chance at interpreting some of these curves because it's something you might need to do in an exam. So this for example I apologise if you colour-blind, but these are the standard colours for these things. Red for earned value, green for planned and blue for actual cost. So we'll do a little a little quiz. In fact he's at the same colours. I think the red has become brown but I shouldn't. I think they've got different symbols in case that's a problem. And the keys at the bottom here. So in the in the project that's on the screen there you can see the planned value curve is the blue one. That's the that's the budget curve. Right. And you've got the actual costs which are a bit less than that. And then you've got the earned value which is down here. So I want you to select four choices from the list on V box. Now describing the status of this project. This is very much exam territory. So it's something you would you need to be able to do. Is this project going well. So reminder CV that's the cost variance SV that's the schedule variance. Those numbers are positive if things are going well. It's worth pointing out that the first term of those metrics is most commonly it's the EV term. So cost variance is EV minus AC, the earned value minus the actual cost, and planned and schedule variance is earned value minus planned. Okay, ten more people left to answer. I think I'll stop it at 30. Just press submit when you're done. I think so. Is anyone unclear what they're trying to do? Now you all seem to know what you're doing. That's good. All right, four more people, and then I'll stop the poll. Excellent. Thank you. So in this one here. Oh interesting. We've got some some different answers. So CV you said CV less than zero an SV less than zero. So both bad and overbudget and delayed are the dominant responses there. And those are all the correct answers. So most people they got that right. Looking at the curves here, you can see that the cost variance is less than zero because the earned value here is sorry the actual cost here. The earned value here is below it. So we're not we haven't earned enough in this project. And the earned value is less than the blue curve as well. So if this earned value curve is down there we're not doing well on on either metric. We want that earned value curve to be to be up higher okay. So now the other value curves in the middle. Hopefully this one's a bit easier for you to answer now that I've explained that. So I've opened the poll there for the next question. So what's the status of this project? Okay, 20 people so far. Let's get the last. The last nine in. Okay, let's view then. I'm going to stop the poll in a second. Hopefully we've got some good answers. Two more people. There we go. All right. So yeah, in this one you can see that the earned value is now above the actual cost, which is usually a good sign. It means we're now under budget. Our budget is now going well and CV is positive. And as you spotted schedule variance is still negative. And we therefore delayed. So yeah majority of people they got that right I think we're getting getting the hang of this now. People are getting this pretty close. Okay. Let's do the third one then. So this time I'll let you interpret this curve yourself. I won't give you any clues. Let's try and get the answer in nice and quickly. Okay, press submit, then get your answer in if you haven't already. Because guess if you're not sure. Hopefully you've got it right. There we go. Excellent. Got a 30. That was good. Nice and quick okay. So you can see that the the earned value curve is still in the middle. But this time the cost and the plan value, the actual cost and the planned value curves are swapped over. So rightly spotted this time. Most of you got that right. So well done. The hardest thing here is actually working out which curves which once you've got that it's relatively straightforward. And then the last one then. So this time the earned value curve right at the top there above both of the other curves. So hopefully that one's really intuitive to everyone. I'll give you a few seconds to if you want to get some points on the board. And then I'll stop the poll in about five seconds. So if you want to get a few points on the leaderboard, now's your chance. If you've got fast fingers. Okay, I'll start the pole in five, four, three, two, one. Look at that. Super speedy and lucky five didn't manage it, but the rest of you did. So yeah, this time the majority of their have got that right. Is anyone not clear then on interpreting these curves? I think it's just something you need to just practice and get used to. Majority of you seem to have got that. There are a few still getting some mistakes in there, but maybe because I rushed you a little bit towards the end. But it's important that we get you practice that one. So let's have a look at the leaderboard. Some some good marks coming up there. Yep. Hopefully you spotted yourself on that list. Well done. To those of you. Average score of 2.9 not so high today. So how do we interpret these curves then. What does it mean. The work is £1,000 late. What does that mean? We're ahead of schedule by £4,000. Not really. It's not really intuitive, is it? Um. These curves are useful for comparing, and it helps us to manage the project. In a world where cost, time and money are kind of interchangeable. Maybe, but it's a bit of a strange thing to be thinking of time in terms of money. But of course, you can actually read these graphs in two ways. We don't have to just read them vertically. The metrics I told you earlier are very much cost related metrics, but you can actually calculate schedule variance in units of time. So we use a slightly different notation here and measure this direction. So you can measure the distance between the earned value and the planned value at that point. And this is telling us that we are we are delayed because the. The plan is that something is delayed. Yes. Of course. Yeah, it's two weeks late. Yeah, the number is positive, but I guess positive means a bad thing, I guess, when you're measuring that direction. So. Yeah. Because. Because you've earned the value two weeks later. Okay. So hopefully that makes sense. And you can you can have a play around with it and think about it in your own time. But you can read the graph horizontally to express things in time units and that might be useful. So what I've done is to give you a bit of practice doing this stuff, because it's pretty important. I've created a little spreadsheet of some example projects I did and how many there are there. You can calculate the earned value and planned value and schedule variance across roads and things for these, and it might be useful for you to do that. So next week I will test I'll ask you the question in the lecture which is the best performer which is the worst. So we can see if you've got that right. We'll do an example just so that you understand what you're trying to do here. So in this particular project project I picked a random one. The budget was about 10,409. 75% of the work has been done, but actually, sorry, 75% of the projects been done. But you would plan to have done 70% by this time. So that sounds like you're doing well. You're slightly ahead of schedule, but what does it tell us about the budget? So we've actually spent £7,817. Is that good? Is that bad? Was that the right amount? We'd have to do some calculations of course, to work that out. And that's where earned value comes in. Of course we calculate the earned value of earned 7807 by doing that simple formula of the planned value times the percent done so. That should be back times. Don't shouldn't it? I think it should be back. But anyway. Yeah. The total planned value. The final planned value 10%. Done. So that formula that is wrong. But don't worry. You can see that we've earned 7807 and we've spent 7817. So we're ever so slightly overspending by a tiny, tiny amount. And likewise and calculate the planned value. Budget times cent scheduled, which tells us that we are ahead of schedule. Right? Because we've spent we planned to do £7,286 of work at this point in time, and we've actually done 7807. So we're doing well in terms of schedule. So that's the that's the utility of this. And look we can calculate the schedule variance. Schedule variances were £520 ahead of schedule. That's brilliant. And we're £10 behind on budget at this point in time. That's the whole point of these metrics. They really tell us that information straight away. And we can calculate the performance indices as well just by dividing those numbers. The performance index tells us that we're very we're efficient in terms of schedule, and we're ever so slightly inefficient in terms of cost. And the combined one is just a multiple of product of these things. So it's it's about the same number surrounding errors in there. But don't worry about that. So yeah that's all you need to do. Very simple. You should be able to fill that spreadsheet in relatively simply. So that's your homework. Um, let's come back to some questions. I think we were supposed to have to break here, so we're obviously running behind schedule, unfortunately, today. But what can we do with this? We can do forecasting. So the beauty of value analysis is not that we can monitor stuff, but that we can actually use it to predict the future. Will the work package be on time and on budget looking at this one, we're ahead of schedule. So it might be that we finish the project ahead of schedule. We can estimate when the project will complete based on this information, based on these efficiencies. That's why they're really useful. Will it be on budget? We're reasonably close to budget. So probably we'll be close to budget maybe slightly under. Of course we have to make assumptions. If we're going to do forecasting, we have to make assumptions. We have to make those assumptions very clear. In an exam, you would have to make your assumptions very clear and well justified to get the marks. For example, we're going to the assumption might be we're going to work at a constant rate, or we're going to work at a constant rate of resource resource consumption, a rate of cash. We need to make those assumptions in order to choose which metric we're going to use to extrapolate. I'm. It's worth pointing out that it's not obvious how percentage done is calculated. If you've done, 50% of the project, is the remaining work of equal value to the first 50%, it's not immediately obvious. Now, you would have to hope that if someone's giving you percentages, then you have to just assume that I suppose. But if you've actually got some really hard things and you do those first, you might have done half the work packages, but you might have done the really hard, expensive ones first. And actually the remaining cost might be very low, even though you're 50% of the way through. So it's it's not clear necessarily how things are measured. So you need to be clear about your assumptions. That's that's the key point here. So what is forecasting. Well those are your usual curves your AC your PV and your EV curves. What you want to do is you want to estimate the end date of the project, and you want to estimate the ultimate cost of the project. So we're essentially trying to extrapolate. So you can see on the slide there the planned delivery was to have done all of these shapes. But we've actually done owning up to this circle, so we haven't done as much of the work as we'd like to. So the remaining work is to do all of this. So you can see we're going to we're going to overshoot. If you add up the remaining work, the size of these blocks kind of can represent, I guess, time. But similarly you could do the blocks in the other direction to represent cost, right. These could be multiplicative if you have an extra dimension to these blocks. But for simplicity's sake this is how this has been drawn here. So what we do is we're essentially extrapolating the actual cost curve to work out what the final total cost is by adding up the remaining work to be done. That's all forecasting is, right? It's just it's just, you know, extrapolating. Nothing particularly complicated, but the assumptions you make are what determine what you're going to achieve. So for example, to calculate the estimated completion, this is the cost of the project at the end the estimated total final budget. Remember we already estimated a budget at the beginning. Now at some later point in the project we want to estimate a new budget at completion. We're going to call this the EAC. We could either trust our original activity estimates. We could just say, well, we got it right first time. We've just had a bad week. Everyone's been ill. We're going to get back up to speed. So our efficiency doesn't matter. What matters is that we planned it correctly first in the first place, so we could trust the original estimate if we wanted to. Which I think I can show you with a little animation here. So we trust the original estimate, and we just do the remaining work at the planned at their planned costs. Or we could, if we wanted to assume that the performance that we've achieved so far in the project is a reliable indicator of the performance that we're going to get from now on. So we can use those those efficiencies that we've calculated to extrapolate the remaining work. So to do that in an animated way, we would stretch the remaining work to match. Okay. So the choice of which metrics we use, we could use cost or schedule efficiency to scale the remaining work. It all depends on the particular project that we're dealing with and the reasons for the delays or the overspend. All right. Now, of course, there is a caveat here in that the reason that our actual delivery is only 30%, it could be, as in this case, because the actual deliveries were kind of stretched out. We'd taken longer than we thought, or it could be that we just did this really big long hexagon first. Do you see? That takes a lot of time. So we've only done two work packages and we thought we'd done three. So our actual delivery is suggesting that we're not doing very well. Well, in actual fact we've operated at a very effective way. Effective rate of work done. So, you know, if you change the task order, that would change the outcome. So there is a caveat there that you need to be aware of. And if the exam question stipulated information about individual tasks, then you would need to factor that into your decisions in your calculations. That's an aside that's you know, in the simple case, let's just not worry about that for the time being. So we've got the. That's the first one. But there are other metrics as well we can calculate. So the estimate to complete. So the estimate at completion that's the final total budget. The estimate to complete is how much we'll need to spend from this point in time to get there. So it's just the difference right? The variance of completion is how much we will have overspent compared to our original budget. And the two complete performance index is what efficiency we need to get to that point. Um. So there are different ways of doing these things as well. So the estimate to complete. Could be calculated by looking at just the difference between the aeaC and the actual spend. Or you could do a bottom up and start all over again and recalculate a new estimate to complete. Assuming that your original estimations were all wrong, variants are complete. There's only one way to calculate that that I'm aware of and the two complete performance index. It all depends on what you set your goal to be. Do you want to know what the efficiency is to do the work to the original budget, or do you want to know the efficiency to achieve the work at the estimated budget? The new estimated budget, I should say. So to view this on the graph here, the EAC. That's the the main thing that we're going to calculate. That's the kind of the projection of the final cost. The variance of completion is, is how much that differs from our original budget. And the SEC is the cost of the remaining work from the current point, okay. And the efficiency is calculated by looking at the value of the remaining work compared to the cost of the remaining work. In much the same way that we calculate any efficiency as the earned value over the actual cost, we can do the. And the value remaining to be earned over the cost remaining to be done. This is the same kind of thing. So the formula looked like this. Not as complicated as it sounds when you think of it logically. So the estimate of completion is calculated in one of these three ways, either by scaling the progress to date, by scaling the final budget, by the efficiency. So you take the final budget and you scale it by the efficiency that we're working at. And that sort of increases it to the to the right number. So that's if we're assuming progress today is a good indicator. Or we can use the original estimation. So what we do is quite simply we take the current spend and add on the work remaining to be done. So that's kind of we're not we're not extrapolating at all in that case. But if we wanted to, we could extrapolate this second term by scaling it by something like the CSI. Which was one of the efficiencies that we had earlier. Also the Schedule performance index, the Spy could also scale it. You might ask, why is this formula different to this formula? It actually isn't. If you put CPI there and do some number crunching, it just results in that top formula there. This is just the long form, the simple form. But it happens to reduce to that if you use CPI as your metric of scaling. Does that make sense. So there's really only two different methods here. But there are three formulae because of mathematical convenience I suppose. And the estimate to complete is just the difference between how much we spent now and how much we need to spend. The variance at completion is the difference in the budget and the new estimate. And the two complete performance indices, as I said, is the value left to earned versus the cost left to spend in two possible scenarios. One of them where we're trying to achieve the. Estimate of completion and what is the efficiency to achieve the original budget that we originally hoped to achieve? It's a lot of formula here. You just have to learn these things. I'm afraid they're not as complicated as you think. Maybe come back and watch this video and remind yourself as you're going through it. Because I realise I've rattled through an awful lot of things there to explain that again, there's the homework you can do. The example, for example, with the example we just talked about earlier, you could keep the original estimate and just apply the formula that I just told you. And you can you can see if we keep the original estimate, then we'll be £10 over spending at the end. If we use the cost efficiency to scale it, then we get a different value and so on and so forth. You can just plug the numbers in and plug the formula in. It should all make sense when you have a play with this at home. The estimate to completion is easy to calculate with the simple formula the budget. The. The variance of completion is also easy to calculate, and the two complete performance index as well, just by applying the formula. What's interesting to note is that the two complete performance index here, 0.999, is the same number we had for the cost performance index here. The this one here have one. Well, that's keeping the original estimate. So we didn't don't worry about that. The cost schedule index. So the two complete performance index by using the cost schedule index matches with this cost holds because there's a there's a good reason for that. And there was an exam question last year about why those numbers are the same. It's by construction right. What efficiency do you need to work out to complete the work to our planned estimate? Well, if we assume we'll complete the work and our cost schedule index, then then the cost schedule index is how efficient we need to work to complete the work to that point. So it's kind of it's circular right. It's by construction. And you can you can play with the numbers and understand that hopefully when you do the homework. Okay. So those are all on Moodle. There's also a link there on the slide. But you'll be able to find them on Moodle in the appropriate section. So recap so far what have we learned today. We've learned about budgeting. We've learned that we're all terrible estimating. And we learned that asking your friend didn't really help. It actually made it made it worse. We've done we've talked about earned value analysis and we've talked about some quite core concepts that are really simple mathematically, but are quite powerful in that you can compare time and money and equate them and do some useful forecasting as a result. So why did we do all of that? Why do we need to do any of this stuff? Well, of course we do all of this stuff because it's important to projects that we can achieve success in the project. And this goes back to what we talked about in week one, about making sure you define your goals. Defining those key goals, and something called key performance indicators is a way that we achieve that. So we're going to talk a bit about that. Why do projects fail. Well this is a web page of this is a thing I found online of common reasons why project fails. I think they did various experiments and statistics on common IT projects, and I'm not going to read them out to you. But you know, a lot of these attitude with communication, issues with communication or to do with defining what you're trying to achieve, managing expectations and requirements, or finally managing resources. So, you know, the majority of these things can be dealt with through normal management. The things that we've talked about so far in this course scope management, time management, cost management, that's why projects fail. And of course, this one here, number eight, there was no longer a need for the project. Well that's just common sense, right? Having that business case, that's something that Prince two would hopefully have ironed out. So the things we've talked about already are how you avoid project failure. But as we talked about in the first session, avoiding failure is not the same as success. Right. There were there were four examples I've given already in this course. So there's the space pen, you know, a fantastically engineered multi multi-million pound project that was ultimately had no business case. It was a white elephant or there was that, that was that bridge, that Mersey Gateway Bridge which was on time on budget. Fantastic. Met all the Iron Triangle constraints, but it probably wasn't as profitable as it should have been to justify all of that expense. Although the Ariane five rocket project, which exploded and you would have said, well, that project was a failure, but actually it was one step in a much bigger project, which ultimately was very successful and profitable. So there is a question of defining the bounds of when project success is defined. And of course, there was the Edinburgh tram project, which didn't, you know, although it was kind of it was very overbudget. It was, it was very late, but it did actually deliver some community benefit in the end, even though it didn't meet even I don't think it met its scope, its budget or its or its time constraints, but it did deliver some community value. So there are other things other than money as well to consider. So thinking about what success is is really important for a project. Defining it is very important. The iron triangle is only three of many possible things, and there's no point delivering within that iron triangle if there are no actual benefits to your end user. So it's really important that your product is of the right quality, that you do a good job, that the product is actually used by someone. There's no point making a software that no one actually uses, that you achieve your business goals, that you use resources effectively, that your team is happy with what they produce and they're able to keep supporting it, maintaining it. There's no point having a piece of software that isn't continually maintained, because it will soon go out of date, that people are proud to have this piece of software, that people need to feel happy with what you've given them. That you followed certain guidelines and best practices, that you've actually realised the benefits that you promised to achieve. Handing over the software isn't isn't everything. You've got to actually also make sure that the benefits that the user wanted in the first place are also met. So you need to evaluate those things. So there are lots of different elements to success that you also need to consider. Now there's something called the key Performance index. Key performance indicator, which is a metric that we measure over time in a project. We set these things as high level indicators of successful progress. They're not something that we check at the end as a as a measure of success. That would be a key success indicator or a key success factor, which is is not necessarily designed in a in a continuous way. A key performance index or indicator is a measure of progress, which is why I've stuck a progress bar picture on the slide there. So these need to be really simple, measurable things, things that you can measure very, very easily. They don't necessarily need to be exactly the right thing, but they need to be sort of correlated to the thing that you want to measure progress in. So they correlated to stakeholder objectives. You're not going to measure student satisfaction, but maybe you'll measure some other metric of student satisfaction, like how many people were smiling when they came into a lecture theatre, or how many people have fallen asleep during the lecture. That might be a useful KPI without having to interview every single student to find out. These KPIs are agreed between the PM and the stakeholders. You know, you probably decide what your key KPIs are before a project, and it's something that keeps everybody focussed on the goals. It's one really important way of keeping focussed on the prize, and that's something that often slips in a project otherwise. An example would be High Speed two, which I think we'll come back to in a moment at this time. So metrics of success and measures of progress at the end of the project. Of course, all of the KPIs should be looking, looking healthy. And during the project you can spot if one of the KPIs is not following the trend that you would have expected. Okay, so this is a slide listing. Lots of examples. I'm not going to read it to you. You can read that in your own time, but it gives you ideas that there are KPIs in all different areas of the knowledge areas that we need to be aware of in a project. In agile, we also use KPIs. In agile, we do something called a burndown chart. We'll come back and talk about this in next week, I think. Or maybe the week after a way of measuring progress as you tick off actions as they get completed in JIRA, the burndown chart will be automatically generated for you. You can see that you're making good progress towards your goal of having completed all the assigned actions by the end of the project. If you are progressing at a rate that is sub is not as steep as this green ideal burndown rate, you might say, oh, there's a concern here. We're not we're not achieving our work at the right velocity. We need to work faster in this sprint to get everything done in time for the demo at the end. This is how we met. People measure progress in agile. If you're a big corporation, you might use something called enterprise resource planning, which is kind of a tool that collects all the business data into one place. You can view performance across the organisation all in one place, and get alerts and messages when when the stock is missing or when there's a problem on the production line, or when you need to sack someone when their performance is falling below standard, you can, you know, organisations are managed from computers, people you know, hire and fire people using computers. That's how things tend to be done in large corporations. You don't actually necessarily need to meet the person. You just press a button and they fall through the ground and they're sent down a shoot out of the door. They've lost their job. So this is this is kind of the principle of data driven management. And some organisations really embrace this. Others don't. It's really useful to have that visual. Visual view of data allows you to make accurate judgements based on real evidence, and allows you to quickly spot mistakes and issues and problems arising. And it means you don't have to have those conversations, which are often hard to have. There are obviously many pros to data management, which I've just mentioned. There are also some cons to data driven management. So for example, you may not be good enough to judge that data or make that assumption. You may not be the right person to be making those decisions based on that data, or you may not understand the data. Sometimes the data is is oversimplifying something. And actually sometimes a conversation will help you better. And. You know, in project environment specifically, since this is a project management course, projects are very unstable anyway, so metrics may not be reliable. When you're doing a sprint in scrum. You know, seeing a task being completed, you know, whether they completed today or tomorrow, it may not be a reliable indicator of progress over the whole course of that sprint. So it's difficult to to trust data driven management sometimes as well. I'll let you study this slide in your own time because we haven't got much time left. So in any project, the bottom line is you need to keep afloat. You need to have a positive cash flow. We talked about that already. So profit is necessary to survival. If you run out of money you can't carry on doing work. You can't pay your workers. They walk home, they walk home. The project is done. So you need that revenue stream. You need a profit margin. You need a certain volume of sales. You want low costs. But. Is it survival at any cost? Would you continue with the project if it involved abusing or exploiting your employees or suppliers or stakeholders? Probably not. Right? And is it feasible? Is it viable to do a project that's unsustainable? If your project involves chopping down every tree in the world, ultimately then it's not very scalable. You probably don't want to go along that line. So pure profit focus, of course, is a very short sighted view. And and it's kind of old, old fashioned and outdated now. Yet still profit is kind of the bottom line. But there are kind of there are other lines as well. Right? There's, you know, the people bottom line, the planet bottom line. And this, this concept of actually managing metrics that aren't just profit, but actually metrics of planetary value and people values and shows that your product, your product isn't just profitable, but it's also sustainable, equitable, viable. And and, you know, people want you to walk out and not want to work with you. By making these things clear in an organisation, then you can actually make sure that people are focussed on achieving the goals of the project that aren't just the profitable ones. Now it's very hard to manage when you've got things in your bottom line, like I need happy employees, but it's an important metric to have, so you may even have KPIs dealing with things like that. So let's very quickly talk about High Speed two. Do you know what High Speed two KPIs were? So there are two on this slide. So I've just opened the poll. I realise we've only got two minutes left. So this is the final the final quiz question of the day. Which of these were High Speed two KPIs? I imagine it's failed on all its KPIs. That's not the question. We don't need to go into the politics of high speed to. Okay. Get your answers in quickly, please. Okay, I'll stop the poll there because I'm conscious of time. Okay. Yeah. So we don't really know is is the bottom line. But predictably, you didn't say the to which I would hope I was hoping you were going to say which are the ones we learned today. Schedule variance and EIC. Of course they use earned value analysis. All good projects would. Those other metrics are quite useful ones, but they aren't high speed tools unfortunately. So yeah, obviously profit and financial progress are useful metrics. There are actually 13 KPIs in High Speed two, if you're interested. Some of those are earned value analysis ones. Others are things like percentage of workforce who are apprentices, or percentage of staff who are women, or from ethnic backgrounds that are less represented in in the construction industry, disability, community engagement and how happy are people with their their parks being destroyed by a train track? That's not going to be achieving its original objectives, right? These are important things. Right? Because if that if these things don't happen, the project isn't going to have the important legacy that it intended to have, obviously. Yeah, it's not going to have that at all now, unfortunately. So they've failed on all of their KPIs. Well done. Let's not talk about that summary of today then. Estimation is hard. So what we try to do is we try to control we try to control things which are to set limits such as budget, schedule and scope. We use KPIs to monitor and track performance. We measure progress and we react to it. We use earned value analysis and tools like that to have an accurate sense of the numbers and progress, and use it to forecast so we can react before something happens. Right? So we can actually anticipate when the problem is where the problem is coming from. And we do all that because we want to achieve success of the project, not just profit, but things beyond profit, but ultimately still profit. Right? You need profit, but you also want those other things too. So this is where we're up to. You should all be in a position now at the end of this week at least, to have finished chapter one. We've already finished all the initiation stuff and you can do a self assessment thing. So I've produced a self assessment form which allows you to assess chapter one. It will talk through some of the things that you need to think about and consider to put in your chapter and help you with understanding how the Mark scheme works. So yeah, I suggest you have a go without self self-assessment. Finish the chapter and have a look at that and we can. I was I did say I did promise to talk about assessment today but I haven't had time. So I'll point you to a short video that I made last year which might help with that. So hopefully you have everything you need to get on with the essay. I'll just quickly check if there are any burning questions. Lots. Okay, we'll we need to memorise all the formula for the final exam. Or will they be provided? Yes, you'll need to memorise them, but they're not as complicated as they first seem. You will learn them very, very easily. There are so many formula I'm sorry about that. Is being colour-blind an actual concern for the exam? No. The exam would be in black and white. Do we need to learn the abbreviations or their full name be given in the exam? Their full name will be given in the exam and the abbreviation. So hopefully you'll be able to utilise both of those and does determine ahead or delayed and CV term in under over budget. Correct. Well done. So that's all for today. Thank you very much. See you next time. See you on Thursday.
