I. Did you guys manage to see your peer assessment results? Did that thing work? Did it make sense?

UNKNOWN
Okay. Yeah, yeah. I got to be over, but I'm sure that we're going to do.

SPEAKER 1
The counter.

SPEAKER 0
Work. They should. They should have the. The captions are included. Yeah. Not the figure itself, but the captions are included, I think. Yeah. It's good. It's good to make this mistake in the practice round. Oops. Okay, so I guess I'll begin. So today we're going to talk about leadership and teamwork. Now I've kind of put this at the end of the lecture series. Not because it's the least important, but because you've probably got a bit of time to reflect now on the stuff you've done in your groups during the ER, the seminar work, and maybe some of this stuff will make some sense. If I told you all this stuff at the start, you probably wouldn't have understood why I was saying it. But hopefully this is something that you can, you can relate to now. So before we begin, let's just recap where we are in the module. You are now at the stage of being able to prepare your group presentation, which is due one week on Thursday. There are no seminars allocated to help you prepare for that, so it's something you'll need to allocate time to do in your own time. The project presentation I realised that we have two different seminar groups, so some people may be getting advice from me, other people may be getting advice from the tutors. It's really important, therefore, that you do read the official guidelines on the module web page and figure out so you know what you're talking about. There's only five minutes to speak. That means there isn't enough time to tell me all the details of your project so far. What I'm really interested in is that Dragons Den pitch, that kind of that delivery of why is your project valuable to the stakeholders? That, for me is the most important thing to get across in that presentation. So really make it impactful, really make it engaging. But at the same time, don't just sort of be so high level that there's no detail in there. Sometimes a great salesperson might be kind of very enigmatic and persuasive in some ways, but might miss some of the key details. So try and get some detail in there to show us that you're good at managing projects. That's important. You're being sort of academically assessed on this, but I think the key thing is delivering benefit to your stakeholders. Why is your project going to do that? And obviously you've got to factor in the new constraints, the the email from the boss that came in on Thursday. It has to be factored in there. You need to solve that in your presentation too. Okay. You should also now also have access to the peer assessment results. The advantage of peer assessment is that you get results quite quickly. You get some feedback. The challenge of it is, of course, is that feedback is a variable quality. The hope is that you've got at least one piece of really good feedback that you can really action in order to apply that to your final essay submission at the end of term. I should say that I have moderated the results so that harsh markers have their marks increased and generous markets have their marks reduced to try and establish sort of an overall fair number across the board. This results in sort of a bit of deviation from the original marks that you would have received had you just averaged the numbers that Moodle gave you. I thought it was interesting to note that the submission grade doesn't correlate with the feedback grade. That means people who write good essays aren't necessarily the people who write the best feedback. That was quite surprising to me. I thought there'd be some correlation. There possibly is a very slight positive slope to that, but not really. So that's interesting. I would have thought. Yeah, I would have thought people who were good at writing in one area are probably good at writing another area, but that's not the case. So that's interesting. So maybe that means that you need to focus on on improving in the writing of the feedback area, as well as in the writing of the essay area. So there's there's benefits to be gained in both parts. I think there are skills within giving feedback that will help you with your essay writing as well. This is a distribution of the of the grades. It looks like most people or the mean is slightly above the first boundary. We'd expect it to be slightly below. That means you're all, as a cohort, slightly generous to your peers. That's in your best interest. So that's fine. We will be reviewing the marks and perhaps bringing them down a little bit once we have some tutor moderation of that, just to be sort of make sure it's fair, but I don't mind. I don't mind if you all do really well in the essay. That's okay. And what else have we got on here? Yes. So after moderation, quite a few essays had their marks reduce in quite a few other marks increased based on this normalisation to accommodate for harsh or generous markers. So you can't necessarily trust the numbers your peers have given you. You've got to kind of do a bit of detective work. But let me give you an idea of how you go through and break this down. So I sent a link. So you should all have access to a page that gives you kind of a breakdown of your essay. You've got obviously a top level grade there, which is just the mean of all these different criteria. And you've got an individual breakdown into each of the different criteria. So this particular person has the lowest mark in the use of evidence category. That means they probably didn't bring in references. So they they did good analysis. They were perhaps very reflective and thought a lot about weighing up the evidence that they collected informally or, or whatever, but they didn't bring in evidence from the literature. They didn't have references to the literature. So that's where they lost marks. So hopefully you can see from this top level breakdown some obvious areas where you can improve. But I think more importantly is to review the individual feedback from your peers. You're also graded on the. On your ability to write feedback. Now this is automated so it's not necessarily reliable. This will be subject to tutor moderation as well. But what it does is it tells you where you would if you were too generous or too harsh. So it'll say, for example, this person was slightly high when giving their 20 point mark and it suggests they reduce it by 10%. So that's a prompt to sort of look at the mark scheme and reassess where you're judging people. Was there a question? Right. Where is this? Where is this? So this is on, on on Moodle. If you scroll down to the section results. Let me let me show you on Moodle. Oh, I'll just answer these questions first. Should we use slides or visual aid in the presentation? Absolutely. Using slides is very encouraged. There'll be an HDMI port so you can plug in your slides when giving the group presentation. And how do I assess the contribution. Not all members are present. If you're not present without without kind of unauthorised absence, you'll get zero. Everybody else will share the mics equally, so everyone else will get the same mark except those who don't attend. So everyone needs to be present at the presentation unless there are mitigating circumstances to excuse you from that. Hopefully that answers that question. Okay. Let me show you on Moodle. So on Moodle, if you scroll to the section Individual report, you will see there is an interim results page and that will give you your results. I can't click on that because that would break because I'm not a student. But if you click on that, you should be able to see your results as I'm showing you on the lecture slides. Okay. I. Okay. So you can also see this in the middle grade book. If it's not working on Moodle, you can look at it in the gradebook as well. This is all repeated from there. But this person has been suggested that they reduce their knowledge and understanding. Mark. They were too generous in that category, that kind of thing. So hopefully this makes sense. You just have to read through it. There's quite a lot of text there, but hopefully it's useful. Understanding the specific feedback from your peers is a bit of detective work. You need to sort of establish if that peer was being harsh or fair, based on the averages that I've given you, based on the overall mark breakdown, and also work out if the person is knows what they're talking about, you may have had some peers marking your work who didn't have a clue, but what you need to think of is not just discarding their thoughts, but sort of recognising that they may have a different perspective to you, and there may be some value in what they have to say. So try to derive some value from what everybody tells you, even if you don't completely agree with them. There's a bit of detective work involved to try and figure out what you want to do to action to improve your essay for next time, but hopefully you've got a nice broad, a broad opinion on your work. Okay. Do we have any questions at this point on peer assessment stuff? Yes.

SPEAKER 2
I don't like notifications. I was given to loathe, but when I was.

SPEAKER 0
Um. Yeah, I guess. That sounds inconsistent. I mean, if it's saying that you're too low, but it's fine, then it's obviously not fine. Yeah, it. Yeah it should. The 20 point scale is already on the on the scale of percentages. So it should be correct. But if there's an issue do send me an email and I can take a look. It's possible my automated assessment isn't doing a very clever job because the 20 points aren't equally spaced across the across the grid. Okay. All right. So now we're going to start talking about leadership and teamwork then getting to the academic stuff. So when we look at the PMBoK guide we can find all the different duties of a project manager. Ah that includes things like planning, controlling organising and finally leading. Okay. These are all things that we have covered already in this module. Right? Planning we've covered through work breakdown, through scheduling, through budgeting, lean and agile methodologies controlling. We've dealt with through methods such as earned value analysis for budget management, key performance indicators for progress management and obviously risk management that we did last week organising. We've dealt with right at the start. Then we talked about stakeholder analysis when we dealt with things like RACI matrices last week or Prince two roles, or scrum, the different roles in scrum as well. So we've thought about planning, controlling and organising already. What we haven't really talked about is leading yet. It's one of the key duties of a project manager. Leading involves things like setting the team direction, coordinating activities across different organisational functions, motivating people to do the work and obviously assigning that work. So these all seem like quite easy things. So what I did was I had a look online and try to find some kind of motivational leadership related graphics, and this is the one I came up with, this one I found online seven project management skills that have been overlooked. Anyone notice a problem here? So there were only six. I would add an extra one. Attention to detail. Maybe that is the one that is overlooked so much that the person who made the graphic missed it. But the important thing here is that the overlooked skills include things like soft skills, managing expectations, managing people. There are many, many skills of project management that you can't really learn. You just have to learn through experience. I should say you can't learn them in a lecture theatre, so I don't know why I'm giving you a lecture on this stuff. I guess the point is you learned this through the seminar series, and maybe now you can reflect on some of that. So let's look at some of what these soft skills are. Obviously you know what hard skills are. Those are the things you'll learn in some of your tougher modules. You know, math, statistics, data analysis, accounting, coding. These are all the hard skills that project managers might be able to do. These are the technical things. These are things you can do on your own, right? You can just go into a room with a computer and do these things. These are things we can examine you on very easily. They're all very measurable. But actually it's the soft skills that really set apart a good project manager. These are kind of the personal interpersonal skills, social skills, the ability to interact and negotiate with other people, to deal with conflict, to deal with problems when they arise. When we had the email from the boss last week, up until that point, I think hard skills have been coming into play. The people who were better at planning and organising probably dominated in the sessions, suggesting methods for producing the best Gantt chart or the most efficient way of doing the Kanban. But the soft skills come into play when there's a problem. All of a sudden those planners have to throw their plan away and start from scratch, because the brief has changed, and it's the soft skills of dealing with that crisis, negotiating and working out a solution. The role play activity where the different set of skills start to come to the forefront. So hopefully you got to experience a bit of that last week. Um. I don't know why I include this, because I always forget what it means. This is this is something that PMI did. They did a survey to figure out what the different core skills of project managers should be. And they found these sort of three dimensions of leadership technical, project management and strategic. And business management is kind of the three elements. And according to that survey, 66% of organisations say that technical skills are the most difficult to find. Basically, people aren't trained in project management. They don't know how to do things like producing a decent Gantt chart or managing the work breakdown or something like that. So it's hard to find people with those skills. But over 90% of organisations say that the technical ones can be learned. They're teachable, 66%. It's the leadership skills that are most important for success. So although you are now equipped in the technical project management skills, the skills that you really do need are the soft skills. They're the ones that are going to make you set apart from others when it comes to managing projects. So on today's agenda, we've got these things, we've got decision making. That's one thing that leaders need to do. They need to make decisive decisions to unify people on that common goal. That's what a leader has to do. They have to get people going all in the same direction. A leader who has everyone going in different directions isn't going to make any progress in a forward direction. They need to build teams. They need to establish ultimately trust. They need to make people trust one another. And that is not easy. There was a need to manage the teams and intervene when things go wrong. They need to motivate people. They need to get people to be as productive as possible, and that comes down to understanding their fundamental needs and potentially understanding their personalities as well. So let's start with decision making. So there are lots of quotes in this in this lecture. This is quite an interesting one. Managers do things right. Leaders do the right things. So managers have the technical skills to do things in the right way. But actually choosing what the right things to do are is difficult. So there are different leadership styles that may, may or may not suit you. So you can look at sort of different dimensions of this. You can look at how intense the leadership style is if they're heavily engaged. Or you can also look at how kind of supporting they are, how empathetic they are. So in this bottom corner here, you've got sort of very hands off approaches to leadership. You can just let people get on with it. These are very low engagement, low support kind of situations. You really need to trust your workers to do their job. If you have very excellent, an excellent team that know what they're doing, it's quite nice to stand back and let them do their thing and not get in the way. A lot of software developers like to be led in a hands off kind of way, but sometimes you need a bit more than that. So one way of being a bit more than that is to be very commanding. You just tell people what to do. You just say, this is what we need. Do it now. Go and do it. You don't provide any support there. You just tell them what to do. Very dictatorial kind of approach to management. And people don't tend to like that. That tends to rub people up the wrong way if you just tell them what to do. However, if you know what's best, maybe it's the right thing to do. Maybe if you work force has limited skill or ability to think for themselves, then maybe that's a good approach. I don't think for software development though. Alternatively, you can try a more nurturing approach. You can. Instead of telling people what to do, you can try and support people to do their job best so you can ask them what's wrong. This is kind of a very agile approach, the sort of the servant leadership kind of thing. You figure out what they need and you provide that support so that they can maximise their productivity. But then this is kind of category at the top, where you're very kind of engaged with the teamwork and you're very supporting. And this is kind of it's coined inspirational leadership. And to do that you kind of have to provide a vision. You have to present a vision that really motivates people and also sort of facilitate that vision to come to life. So we're going to think about these different leadership styles and trying to figure out where you fit. So have a look at these different options here. So I've kind of split the four different quadrants into these different types. Right. So you've got kind of within the nurturing category. Let's start with the hands off. You've kind of got the the laissez faire. Do what you think I don't care. Transactional. You know what to do. You'll be rewarded if you do it. You'll be punished. If not. So it's still very hands off. People know what their expectations are or bureaucratic. There's a fixed process. Here's a document. Follow the process. I'm not going to tell you what to do. You can read it for yourself. That's kind of how universities operate. These are very scalable right. Because there's very little management overhead. And that works very well for organisations like like universities or large banks where they've got a lot of people commoditized labour, such as all the different lecturers who can sort of be treated as disposable assets. It's very easy to scale up a university formula using these kind of methods. But let's look at perhaps the more nurturing style, right. This is kind of more suited to software development, I think. So you've got the servant leadership kind of where the the person is there for you, they're going to help you to do it, or you've got maybe the coach, somebody tries to train you up but can help you by showing you what you might want to consider, but not sort of telling you what to do, or more affiliative style where you're putting. The people first. So you're kind of recognising the importance of the team and listening to the team. Alternatively, you might come across these in some organisations. So the commanding types, right where you've got, you know, the autocratic kind of the dictator telling you what to do. But more gentle ones than that. You can perhaps have a more persuasive style, you know. This is what I think we should do, because I know best, and this is why. And somebody persuades you and tells you why it's a good idea might be more effective than a commanding type, or perhaps consultative someone who is good at sort of making the right decision, but doesn't necessarily know what the variables are yet, can ask the team, what do you think? What should we do? And then listens to all the evidence and makes a firm decision, and that's the direction the team goes in. That's a very useful person to have someone who chairs and facilitates and then leads through through consultation. So that might be a very effective way of dealing with a project, whether a weather, a constraint like time. Because often committees are very slow and they take a long time to make decisions. It's quite good to have a decisive leader. So that's perhaps a more suitable commanding approach. And finally, kind of these inspirational ones, you can have someone who's very visionary, who presents that vision, someone who transforms the way you think by presenting that vision in a nice way, or perhaps pace setting someone who leads by example, someone who gets their hands dirty and leads by showing you what's possible. Someone who's really inspirational in that way. So I want you to think about some of these different people and see where you think they fit on that spectrum, based on the ones I've just showed you. So the link is at the top there. Warwick, UK, PM 49. So we'll start with CEO of McDonald's, the guy who made the McDonald's franchise. He transformed it into a different kind of organisation that was based on strict rules and specifications. The burger has to be exactly this thick. The bun has to be exactly this dry or toasted for exactly this long, figuring out exactly what variables were necessary to make the franchise scalable across huge, huge geographic distances to make it, I think at 1.1 of the most successful companies in the world. So where does that person fit? What kind of leadership style is that? I should point out, of course, that he took a lot of inspiration from the lean Kanban philosophy when developing the McDonald's franchise. He didn't invent it all from scratch. Okay. Should I stop the pool there? Anyone else? Anyone else getting their answer in? Okay. Stop right there. Okay, so we've gone for okay. Bureaucratic right. He set he set a specification a fixed speed of a specification. So absolutely right. Bureaucratic is all about setting a formal document or specification that people can follow. If you figure out exactly what the right document should be, then that's a really good way of doing things. I don't know if any of you, if you've seen the film The Founder, but this is a this is a nice clip. I don't know how realistic it was of how they figured out exactly where everything should be in in the McDonald's layout. I've got no sound. I'm afraid you have to just imagine he's a. He's telling them all what to do. There we go. Conducting them. It's well worth watching. It's a very interesting film anyway. But let me skip to the slide, okay. Margaret Thatcher, then another fantastic leader, some may think. So for those who don't know, she was an influential British politician at the end of the last century, the first female prime minister, of course, and very divisive in some of her policies. She created a lot of enemies, but she was certainly very determined. And she got the nickname The Iron Lady for that. So the bottom there, she was known for a blunt communication, and she took people on head on. She was very confrontational in politics and created a lot of a lot of disagreement, but also got things done through that approach. So what kind of leader was she? Okay, I'll stop the poll there because that's how many we had last time. Absolutely. So she actually swapped this slide out I used to have out of Hitler last year, but I switched it out for her from Margaret Thatcher. It was the same, obviously same poll result. Autocratic. Not that I would equate the two. Some might. So she certainly wasn't persuasive. So quite a few of you said persuasive there. She didn't try to persuade anyone. She just told people the way it was now, that leadership style, because she was so, so convincing. And so it was quite persuasive because she was so determined and assertive with her views. People were persuaded and were did buy into that vision, or at least some people did. Obviously, the people on the other side of the argument didn't. So it wasn't it wasn't really persuasive. It was really she told people how things were done. Okay, Nelson Mandela then a good you now. So Nelson Mandela, of course, famously ended apartheid in South Africa. He ended it. He was in prison, of course, for many decades. And eventually, after all of that sort of fighting and battling and, and attempts to sort of fight for the rights of all people in South Africa, then he finally became president, which, you know, that was a pretty tough journey. So what kind of leader was he? So I think this is this is a slightly trickier one because I think he's a lot of those things, but I'm specifically interested in his leadership style. Okay, we'll stop the poll there. Okay, so I think you're absolutely right that he was a visionary. He could see a version of reality that currently wasn't the status quo. He saw a different view of the world. However, I think his leadership style is consultative. Okay. And the reason for that is that he allowed everyone's views to be heard. He thought that was crucial. He's certainly a Democratic leader, and consultation is kind of the necessity of democracy. So much so that this kind of this power here, right. Instead of getting revenge and all the people who the people who put him in jail, you know, the political parties who, you know, fuelled and benefited from apartheid, he forgive them, he involved them in the new government. He recognised that there were people who believed in some of those old fashioned views, and he needed them on board. So he actually involved them in the new political regimes. And that was really necessary for the healing process. Otherwise I'm sure they would have probably opposed him continuously and probably toppled him through kind of violent methods. Instead, he created a new version of South Africa through through inclusion and consultation in democracy. So that's why I said consultative there. But I think he absolutely must have been a visionary to have seen what was possible and to have enjoyed it as well. Okay, so finally then Elon Musk, now he's a controversial figure, of course. He's, you know, he's hell bent on getting to Mars. That's his driving goal. And he knows that to do that, he's going to have to build a rocket that can sort of launch and land repeatedly. And he knows that to do that, he's going to need it. Also batteries that can power vehicles on the moon. And, you know, everything he's done has been to achieve that. So he's got a long a long term goal that's driving everything. So will your answers. Only three people have answered so far. So if anyone's seen the film, they might have. It's slightly different, a different view of him to the way that paragraph puts it. So let's see what you think. Okay. Some people are hesitant. Just guessing. It's okay. Don't be shy. Okay, I'll stop the poll in a second. Get your answer in there now. No three people have abstained. Fair enough. You don't like Elon Musk, so. Yeah, absolutely. I think those who have said transformational and visionary, he is someone who has has that vision. I had to really struggle to not say that word when I was describing him. He has a really clear vision of what he wants to achieve, and he has brought those people in his teams on board with that, to some extent persuasive. But I think actually a lot of autocracy there. As you see, when he took over Twitter, his behaviour was was horrific. You know, he's made an embarrassment of himself. And I think actually when you look beneath the surface of Tesla, he's actually quite an abusive leader. He's quite, quite controlling. And he does that in a sort of a pace setting kind of way in some ways, because he controls himself by the same standards. He expects his workers to work, but he's expecting people to work 24 over seven just like he does. So he's a bit of a psycho, really. But other than that, I think he certainly is also a transformation and visionary. But I think pace settings are good. A good guess for those who said that. Okay, let's see the leaderboard. There we go. Some some good scores on the board now. Not so great scores but okay fair enough. Hopefully you learned something through that process. Nobody's managed to break even. So let's talk a bit more about decision making. How do you make good decisions? How do you make the right decisions? Well, that's not so easy. So there's actually a method to help us of course, straight from the PMI textbook. The Proact decision making method helps you make the right decision fast. And that's crucial right. So what does Pro stand for? First of all pro stands for problem. What's the problem you're trying to solve okay. Define the problem. Always. The first thing you should do when making a decision. And then what are objectives of the solution. So what are the goals. So you define the problem. Then you define the goals. Next alternatives. You must consider what the options are. If you just pick the first option that comes into your mind, you're not really coming up with any solutions, right? You're just picking the first one that comes to your head. I mean, that's what was the point, right? That wasn't good decision making. So this phrase a decision is only as good as the next best solution, as the next best alternative. You've got to consider alternatives. Once you've done that, tabulate the consequences, the cost and benefit of each of the different alternatives. As you compare the consequence of choosing each one and then clarify the trade offs when you choose one, what do you lose? So I guess consequences is kind of the outcomes. Trade offs is kind of the the negatives, the kind of the costs, costs and benefits to make a decision. So it sounds relatively simple, but if you do that, if you follow those steps, you should be able to make very quick decisions because, you know, you might get what quite often happen, happens when you're dealing with situations is that you get as far as three and you realise you don't have enough information. You can't tabulate the alternatives, you're stuck, you lack knowledge. There are some some uncertainty, and then you end up dithering because you're not sure. Or you might get to steps four and five and and realise, oh, I can't decide because this one's good for this reason, but not good for this reason, and this one's good for a different reason. And I can't decide which one. And you're stuck between two suboptimal solutions. If you follow these methods, follow these steps. Then when you get to that point, it should just be black and white. You get to the point of the trade offs and decide, well, okay, which one do I want of these two? There's no wrong answer. I just need to pick one. If you can't decide, toss a coin. Doesn't matter, right? You just pick one. So it's forcing you to think of all the things you need to think of. And once you've gone through those steps, just make the first decision that meets those requirements. There's no point worrying should I have picked the other option? That's the key. It's also too important to consider uncertainty when you're making a decision because you know things. The information you have is of a certain quality, and you need to be aware of that uncertainty so that when you make your decision, you're not you're making it within that kind of within that context so that you're not making. So you're not saying we're going to go with this decision. It's 100% likely to succeed, but instead you can say, we're making this decision. We are aware of these risks and we're accepting them. You need to also think about the risk tolerance. If you're taking a choice, there may be a certain risk appetite for certain situations and not others that needs to be factored into your decision. Otherwise, you might end up taking reckless decisions that aren't within the affordability of your organisation. And also remember that decisions are linked to other decisions. So you make one decision. There may be another decision downstream that may be affected by that. So also think about these things. So it's important to not just follow this method blindly but to also consider the wider context. And finally to beware of cognitive biases. So there are lots of these. I don't think I'll go through them all, but I'll go through some of them. So this is a cognitive bias that I used to always run as a poll in the lecture theatre, but it never seemed to work. The idea is, the theory here is that if you go to bar A, you're more likely to choose the pint than the bottle because it feels like you get a lot more quantity. For your money. It feels better value, right? So 80% of people apparently choose the pint in this scenario, but if there's a can for slightly less than the bottle, it makes the bottle seem relatively much better value. So people tend to pick the bottle. So people tend to be overreliant on the information they they have, so they don't really know enough about things. But what they do know is that the can is 160 in the bottle is a little bit, you know, a little bit better than a can and not much more expensive. So they just think, oh, it must be good value. So they use kind of they make those decisions blindly so they don't really factor in the correct things such as cost per unit millilitre or something like that. You know, there are more effective ways of working out the cost effectiveness of things. But I think this is always confounded by the fact that you probably already had an eight preference. You might like to prefer the flavour of drinks from different shape shaped containers. So maybe this is a bad example, but the idea is is tends to be the case. Most shopping experiences online tend to present you with three options, and they're pretty certain most people will pick the middle one. Often the premium one is deliberately priced out of reach because they know nobody wants it. But the higher they make that number, the better value the middle option feels. So they deliberately play with prices to manipulate our biases. The availability heuristic. We don't have all the information we need to make decisions. Therefore, we tend to rely on what we already know. We overestimate, in fact, the importance of the information we already have, and we perhaps underestimate the importance of the other information that we don't bother to seek. Another bias is the bandwagon effect. You tend to copy other people. You tend to assume that they've made a judgement of what's the right decision, and then you sort of just steal their idea. For example, everyone knows that agile is the best approach. There may be kind of a groupthink element there that we were all kind of just believing that's true, but actually, maybe it's not. Maybe Prince two is the way to go. Blind spots. People have blind spots. You might not like a particular person and ignore someone, or you might ignore someone because you think they're biased, even though sometimes they might say valuable things. So you need to recognise your own cognitive biases, and people often don't. Another back to the beer example. People tend to stick to their first choice. So in this example, if suddenly a counter was introduced, people will stick with a pint. They've already made their decision. They're not going to change it. So people don't like to change their mind. Probably why a second referendum on Brexit wouldn't have changed anything, despite the fact that public opinion had swayed significantly since the first poll. Clustering, we find patterns. Human beings like to find patterns. And if something happens twice in a row, you just assume by induction that's going to happen forever. If you miss a couple of buses, you think that's rubbish? I'm going to buy a car. You don't allow the full the full data set to it to answer the question for you. Confirmation bias is a common one. People like to confirm their own theories, so they often seek answers that support what they already believe. They retrospectively do a literature review to support their idea for their project, rather than doing the literature review first. I'm sure all of you have done that. Confirmation bias is important because it's going to impress your examiners that you did some literature review, but it's also problematic. You may actually be doing completely the wrong thing. I hope not. Conservative bias. People tend to be slow to accept new ideas. Some of us are different. Some of us are the opposite of that. Some of us love to to buy the next phone, even though our current phone is perfectly fine. Other people are more conservative, and the majority of people tend to be quite resistant to change. For example, you all might think these different social media are the best, but actually musil's better than all of them for social media. I recommend you try it. It's really good. Really good chat feature. Now, this is a problem that I think plagues many students who I supervise. This idea that you need all the answers you need to do all the research. We often feel like if we don't know something, we should. We should read more. We should learn more. And that's a useful thing that sort of combats the fact that we sort of otherwise might just bury our head in the sand. But also sometimes we seek information when we don't need it. For example, if you're going through the Proact method and you think, oh, I don't really know enough about this, I'll do more research, then you're not going to make a quick decision. And quite often we seek information that we don't even need to make that decision. So if you come with a situation of needing some information, you should make sure that you have a clear objective of what you're trying to answer with that information. Don't just read every paper, but read a paper searching for a specific piece of information in order that you can better make your decisions. That's fine. Rather than just, you know, keep doing more and more research when you're uncertain. Because the truth is, you'll never know everything. So you have to at some point make decisions. The opposite being the ostrich effect, where you just you kind of ignore. You ignore things because you don't want to face them. Bury, burying your head in the sand. Outcome bias. This is where we kind of are biased based on our what we have. Let me let me try and make sense of this one. Yeah. I'm not. I'm not quite sure how to describe this one, but the idea that we kind of we're linked when we have an outcome, we get a result. We tend to sort of almost be confirmation bias to ourselves, to our same result. Overconfidence. You may know, overconfident people. Similarly, there's under confidence. People have different biases. These same biases don't apply to everyone. But we often think what we know is better than what somebody else knows. We all know about the placebo effect. You know, often these things are self-fulfilling. If you think it's going to be a hard exam in this module, it probably is going to be. If you go into that exam being confident, you'll probably do better simply from the placebo effect. So that's a good, good advice for you. Get an extra 10% just by being overconfident. This this is a common thing for young people. Pro innovation bias. You like gadgets. You like technology. You like to write complex generalisable solutions to algorithms rather than just sticking with something simple, believing that innovations are going to solve the world's problems rather than just actually reducing our carbon emissions through common sense. You know, it's perhaps convenient to believe in these things, but actually, the reality is it's probably not going to make. It's not going to solve the world's problems. It might actually cause new ones. We tend to be biased to things that happen. More recently, things happened a long, long time ago. We tend to forget things that happened recently. We tend to tend to favour the latest information, even if it's got the same value as old information. We tend to misjudge risk. So we tend to think cycling is dangerous. And because it's I guess it feels more dangerous or some intuitive thing, whereas actually we're more likely to to need a helmet when we're a pedestrian or driving. Yet we only wear helmet when cycling. We tend to to make poor judgements based on the salience of things, selective perception. So I'm going to show you a short video. I want you to count how many times the ball gets passed. You may have seen this before. If you have, don't cheat. How many passes does the team in white make? So don't muddle it up with the team in black. Okay. Was it a music? Did anyone get the right? Everyone get 13. And did you also spot the moonwalking bear? Now, if you don't see this before, you've got to watch. You've got to watch out for the moon walking bear. Let's watch it again. While you're busy watching that counting. Look, there's this moonwalking bear right there. Look at that. So when you're attending to one thing, can I skip the slide? And that can't.

Here we go.

So the point is, when we're paying attention to one thing, we're not paying attention to other things. Our perception is very selective to what we're doing. So when you're focusing on one task, you're not seeing other things going on around you. Obviously stereotyping I mean, you're a bunch of students. You know what stereotyping is. So I don't need to explain that to you. Survivorship bias, the idea that the winners write the books, write the history books. Right. We misjudge things because we don't realise that, you know, there may be really important information, but that the people who didn't win or didn't get to write the books could have shared with us. For example, the most successful investors are the ones that take the biggest risks. Well, that's not necessarily true. There are a lot of very unsuccessful investors who took big risks, but they didn't last very long in the company. So the company might be dominated by these risk averse people who sort of risk prone people who are taking big risks. But that doesn't mean it's the correct strategy. In fact, just as many were failing. And finally, zero risk bias. People don't like taking risks. Last week we did that experiment, and I think one person in the audience decided they would take they just rather take £500 than potentially gain three times that through the toss of a coin. People don't to avoid risks. And that's, you know, being risk averse, having a risk appetite isn't necessarily optimal. It's a bias. Okay. So a good leader needs to be decisive. They need to make good decisions and good decisions quickly. Now that doesn't mean making bad decisions quickly. Reckless decisions or impulsive decisions. That would be stupid, right? But they do need to make good decisions, and they do need to make them quickly. So they need to be measured, reasoned, and risk aware. That's why we have this proactive method being aware of their biases, being aware of all the other problem issues. The reason you need to make decisions quickly is because you learn from mistakes and you learn from experience. And if you don't just get on with it, you're just going to dither around and delay and not actually make any progress. You don't make any progress or any knowledge by idling. You often don't make much progress by just gathering more research because of that information bias. So why waste time planning when we could be learning, right. That's that's a central philosophy in many lean practitioners books. You need to just start doing something, delivering value quickly and getting feedback rather than developing a perfect product that nobody wants. But also another reason why it's important to be decisive. And that means making decisions quickly, is that your confidence can be infectious. It can help lead your team. It can provide that vision that helps your team to to understand what's what they need to do, as opposed to a fear of failure. If you are afraid to make a decision, if you're not sure, your team isn't going to be sure either. They're not going to have so much conviction when they do the work, they might go in different directions. Remember, leadership is about aligning people on that common direction. If you are decisive and show them the right direction and everyone pushes in that direction, it will probably be more likely to succeed. Okay. I think I've taken far too long talking about the first one, so we might have to rush through the rest first of all then. So we've talked about decision making. We know why and how to make a decisive decision. Now we need to get the trust of our teams, and we need to get our teams to be be happy. So there's a good saying here if you want to go fast, go alone. That's because teamwork is inefficient. It's slow. It takes a long time to persuade people to do what you want them to do. But if you want to go far, you've got to go together because you can't build an entire smartphone yourself, right? You need teams of people building things, creating things, inventing things. You. So I think that's saying it's very true. You've got to recognise there's a trade off there. So I'm going to ask you now just to sort of wake you up, because I know I've been talking far too much. What makes a team work effectively? I want to hear your opinions of what makes a team work effectively. Reflect on the seminar work. What has made your team work effectively? If you just put yourself, that's fine. You can. You can think that if you want. Okay, I've got 11 answers so far. Anyone got any more? I'll wait a couple more seconds. Hopefully everyone's written something. I think you got to press submit at the bottom or press send. It says. Okay, I've got to stop the poll now. What makes a team work effectively? Let's have a look. Well, I think you've. You've hit the nail on the head there. Communication right in the middle there. Definitely important trust. Obviously you just reading the slide ahead. Absolutely true as well. People are pulling their weight. Yeah I think there's an element of that. But in real life you know you're going to be in teams where people don't pull their weight. So you need to find ways to find effective teamwork, even though that isn't always going to be the case because you can't guarantee that respect. Definitely mutual respect. Their personalities, personalities does certainly have a lot to a lot of influence on the effectiveness of a team. Good leadership, pizza parties, definitely. You know, motivation, incentives, enthusiasm, confidence is good as well. Um, delegating, listening back on communication, decisiveness. These all seem very good answers. Excellent. So I think the fundamental thing underpinning effective teamwork is trust, which is what you said as well. So there's this piece of research from 2002 linking where they determine and how a team becomes dysfunctional. So trust is kind of I said is kind of underpins an effective team. So if trust is missing then we have problems. Trust is something that leads to openness. People can talk freely. They can be honest. They can share. Teams are built on trust. Without trust, we get a fear of conflict. People are afraid to be open and talk honestly with each other. They're afraid of conflict. Conflict is important. Conflict leads to debate. It leads to the idea of a solution, the consensus solution, which is ideally better than what any individual can come up with. So without trust, we don't have that conflict. We don't have that consensus. We have an artificial harmony rather than a true harmony. And that leads to a lack of commitment. If you're all pursuing a goal that you don't really believe in, if there's no actual consensus in agreement on what you should do, then the decisions you make are going to be ambiguous. They're not going to be the right decisions. And then people want to avoid accountability. People don't want to commit. People don't want to own the project. Standards start to drop, starts to get messed up, and people don't really care about the results. People become accountable to themselves, they become selfish, and their egos tend to dominate. So that's what happens if there isn't trust. And I think you can. You can see how each of these steps follows and how if you just introduce trust at the bottom, things will start to work. So I'm not going to read through these slides because I've already talked too much. But you can read these slides in your own time. These just talk about different things that are perhaps familiar to you from effective teams you've worked in, or perhaps the converse things that you find unfamiliar or find that were lacking in bad teams that you've had. So I'll let you read that in your own time. Okay. So how do you manage a team then. So you've got a team that trusts you. You've got that good team spirit. But teams don't start that way. A team has to be brought together from from nothing. So I think this is a nice one. This. This says that we don't get harmony when everybody sings the same note. Right? If everybody sings the same note, it's just. It's just just one note, right? If Harmony is is about those different notes playing together, contributing to create something better, a chord, something more harmonic. So teams go through stages in order to get to being productive and sounding good, because if everyone just sings a random note, it's pretty horrific to get teams performing effectively. You start from this kind of forming stage. People get to know each other. People tend to be a little bit wary at this stage, and soon that wariness turns into into conflict. Not productive conflict, but unproductive conflict. This is called storming. People are still individuals. They have to adapt and change. And that takes some time. But through effective team management, you can start to get teams norming, working together, finding group solutions to their collective problems. In fact, that conflict needs to be turned into productive conflict. Finally, teams can be in a sort of performing stage where they're very efficient and effective and work together. They don't even need the management anymore. They just get on with the job. And finally the team can perhaps adjourn. They can complete the project, or they can start sharing the work with other teams. So you can sort of plot team effectiveness on a graph like this. Right at the start. You're sort of orienting yourself. You're just sort of figuring out who's who. But quite quickly, the differences between individuals start to cause problems. This is where the inefficiencies of teamwork kick in. People's opinions tend to either be one side or another, and people tend to say, well, I don't agree with you. I want to do it this way. But that's not, you know, you get these sort of leadership battles. People kind of want to resist control by one individual. Now, I'm not describing here how to get people up to that norming stage. We'll do that in a moment. But when you get into the norming stage, you start to get the sense of cohesion. People start to bond across the conflict. Hopefully you found a way to work yet whilst also accepting differences. You haven't just backed down and said yes, you were right, we all agree with you. Oh leader. Instead you found a collective decision, a consensus that we already talked about and you can work effectively despite those differences. And then in the performing stage, we finally get that openness and that trust, flexibility, that diversity, the really important things that are going to get the team satisfied and working effectively. Now, at this point, the team could just stop doing what they're doing, or they could start informing other teams and sharing those lessons with future teams, or they could start conforming. Conforming is the idea that what you are as a team, you start thinking in the same way. You start to get so well, you start to understand each other so well. You all start thinking in the same way. And that creates this thing called groupthink or politics start to dominate. And the person who is kind of socially the leader, the alpha of the group, perhaps will start to dominate all opinions. People will just agree with them because they want to be their friend. Perhaps the social factors become more important than the project factors. Ultimately, that you lose perspective, you become biased, and the group stops being an effective group. We no longer have that conflict, and you need that conflict to get productivity out of a team. So productivity tends to drop in a team eventually. You need to keep things fresh. Ultimately, the team will deform, meaning they'll no longer be effective at all and disband. Now, of course, there are ways to sort of renormalise the team through intervention, perhaps changing things around, changing the leadership. It's important to not keep the same team forever to get back into that performing stage. And this is a sort of a continuous process. So there is still management intervention needed later on. Um, now, this here suggests the kind of things we can do to facilitate the stage movement. So at the start, you know, you want to the leader is going to sort of give some icebreakers. They're going to get people sharing that common vision. You're trying to align people on a common goal. When conflicts inevitably arise you need to build trust. And you do that through speaking to people one on one, trying to get get people to focus on ideas. So when two people are in disagreement, they're kind of fighting against each other. But if you say, well, look, what's what's the problem we're trying to solve, what ideas have you got? Can we collect those ideas together and pick the best of both? You know, ultimately what you come up with might be better and both people might have full buy in with that. So focusing on ideas and tasks and getting people to unite on solving those problems can help. Then we start getting to the norming and you can be a bit more hands off. Encourage interaction, encourage communication to try and get people to get into that performing stage performing. You want to get the team reflecting so that they can continue to improve, and see if you can get even more out of them when they start to to to get groupthink kicking in. When they start norming, you need to refresh things. You need to review the team, introduce new people to it, get outside voices, move to new projects, rotate leadership, all these kinds of things to try and improve the project. Okay, there's a slide which summarises everything I just said in case I went too quickly. You can read that in your own time as well. Okay, so let's summarise what we're up to so far. We've got some decisive, proactive decision making. We've got a team where people trust one another. The team is able to get through that storming stage and is now performing effectively. There's something we haven't really talked about, which is the individual people. A team is not, you know, a number on a graph, right? It is. Each person has their own specific needs. And to get each member of that team working effectively within that team is it takes an understanding of that. So this quote referring to the carrot and stick, the carrot being the incentive and the stick being something you beat the donkey with. If you treat people like donkeys, they will perform like donkeys. I think this is completely true. People are motivated not through punitive things like this, but through more effective methods of motivation. Certainly in software development, you can't just keep hitting someone until they write the right code. When there's a creative process involved, there needs to be a certain element of nurturing. The people you employ in a software environment tend to be people who can motivate themselves, so they don't need these, these methods. So ideally, you've got people who are already self motivating. So what all you need to do really then is to remove any threats, any impediments, anything that are going to impediment their affect, their self esteem or self motivation, perhaps ultimately trying to understand what drives them, what are their goals? What do they want to get out of this? What benefits can they receive? If you try and help each member of your team to realise their own personal goals, that might be an effective way of getting that team player to to also contribute their share to the team. So you may have come across this before. This is the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is a basic psychology thing. Everybody needs all of these things to be fully self actualising, to be fully happy. And as an employer or as a team leader, you want to get your team self actualising what does that mean? Well, let's start off with at the bottom. Everybody needs food, water, warmth and rest. If you are treating your workers to not getting lunch breaks or they're desperately dehydrated, they're not going to care about your job. They're not going to care about your project. They're just going to be crawling across the desert looking for water or whatever. You know, you can't treat people like slaves, right? It's not going to work. Slavery is not an effective way of getting your teams to work effectively. Despite some of the ideas I heard in last Thursday seminar to to maximise cost effectiveness, you might save costs, but you don't get effectiveness in that situation. You do need to to satisfy those basic needs above that of a safety need. If you've got all of your physiological needs met, what are your safety needs? You need security. You need an income that you can, you know, that can keep you in a home. For example, you need you need a shelter and things like that. You need people to afford a house safety. You don't want to be doing a job that involves dangerous risk to your life for a prolonged period of time. So I think that's a pretty obvious that everybody needs those things. If you've got those things, then you can start building on them, right? People have a need for belonging. They need to feel a sense of belonging. They also need love. I don't know if it's the responsibility of the workplace to give you that, but certainly a sense of belonging and feeling of friendship is important. If you feel very isolated and lonely in the workplace, you're not going to stick around in that job. If you feel like it's a really great place to work and you can make loads of friends, that's that's going to motivate people. Above that, you've got esteem needs. People need to feel important. They need to feel like they've done something useful. So you need to sort of satisfy their esteem and self-esteem. So ultimately, once you've done that, they can start to become the self actualising people who can achieve their full potential. Now, I think this needs to be updated with technological needs, because these days you need to have good five g. Otherwise, you know, it's a basic human need. Now we're all kind of cyborgs now and I think we need to recognise that. So I think this Maslow's hierarchy is a bit out of date. When I put this in in the first place, I thought it was a joke, but I actually do think we are becoming increasingly cyborgs once we start having open AI chips on our clothes, doing all of our thinking for us, then I think it's going to become even more important to think about that. So the kind of things you can do, you can make sure that you've got decent working hours, decent pay, deal with the things like building trust and openness and facilitating team building and things like that, and introducing rewards. These are all kind of ways to sort of get people incentivised and motivated within an organisation. Some common reasons why people are demotivated. Well, they may not feel that the support is there. They might not feel the trust is there. They may be personal conflicts that you have as a manager spotted or resolved. There may be things that have happened outside of the workplace that aren't really even for you to see. So, you know, these things do demotivate people and make them not as good at their job or just overburdened, right? Maybe you are literally overworking your people. Maybe you need to spot that. So I'm not going to read through these slides describing how you do this. But to deal with these problems, there are different methods you can consider ways of dealing with conflict, how to get people talking and choosing the best solution collectively, and how to manage expectations. All the things we've talked about already. In our project management module. So you should already know how to define scope and manage expectations and things like that through what we've already learned. But do you read those slides in your own time? Okay. So finally then people, we talked about people. We now have a team of people who we're hoping to get motivated. But somebody said earlier that different personalities matter and that slide earlier. Personalities are an important part of an effective team, and different personalities are going to compute different things to a team. So diversity is the art of thinking independently together, right? You're not all thinking in exactly the same way. You're all thinking in different ways to solve the same problem. And that's where creative solutions come from. So we want diverse teams. We all recognise that we have different skills, and we want to bring those skills together so we can benefit from the group of skills. But we also in having those different skills, we also have different needs and different preferences, different ways of seeing the world, different ways of interacting with the world, different ways of making decisions. So when we combine all of those different things, personalities become quite complex. So everyone's different. Everyone's team is different, right? So we need to utilise and utilise and take advantage of those differences. Being an effective leader is about taking advantage of the differences within a team. It's the diversity that makes the team valuable. Otherwise it's just a group of clones. I think I gave a reference in previous years to the Star Wars Clone Wars. I think the clones were pretty useless because they were just sort of doing the same kind of thing. But I think somebody gave a counterargument, so I'm not going to use that this time. In real life, clones are not not useful. They're not they don't make for a good team. So we can analyse teams and put people into different categories. Not that you fit into necessarily one category or another. So this is a Bell Bin's team role. So what they did was they did an experiment where they did various tasks with different personality types on different teams, and they discovered that the most effective teams had people, people, people on their teams thinking people on their teams and action people on their teams. A combination of skills and personality types was optimal for a variety of widest variety of tasks. Okay, each of these roles have different strengths, different weaknesses. There's no right or wrong role to have. You may feel like I want to be that role. That's the role that really sort of calls to me. But, you know, every role has both its strengths and weaknesses. There's no kind of perfect role, and all roles ultimately are needed for a high performing team. So do we have time for this? Yeah we do. Okay. So let's let's take a look at this this slide. Then this tells you all the different roles I want you to figure out where you fit. Which of these roles is most like you. Which of these roles do you feel like the most the strongest calling to you. So you can you can pick, I think, up to two. I think I've allowed you to pick up to two. So try and decide where you fit. Oh. Okay, I'll give you a few more seconds to do that. Okay, I'll stop the poll there. If you haven't press submit, do so now. I interesting. We've got a good spread across the group. I wasn't I wasn't expecting that actually, but that's good to see. So we've got some good team players in the room that's good to see. Okay, so yeah, I guess not many resource investigators, people who like to explore opportunities and develop contacts. I wonder where those people are. Could just be could be randomness. But it's good to know. If we were a team, you'd be very effective. We'd be able to do most of the team's functions together. Hopefully you can see that with those strengths or those weaknesses as well. And you need you need different roles to compensate for your weaknesses. So after having picked what you've picked, have a look here. Don't be surprised if they and then see if that see if you think that's true. Do you often make these mistakes yourselves? Those who are team workers? You hesitant to make unpopular decisions? Do you care too much about the team, thinks about you and you've got an important role to the team as well. It's important to recognise that as well, so hopefully that's giving you some insight into your own personal personality. It may be interesting to go and speak to your teams from your seminar groups and see if, see what, see what distribution of roles you've got on your team, and see if there are some weaknesses in your team that that that you feel like a true. And then I'm going to this last thing now, this last personality related thing. You may have heard of Myers-Briggs as well. This is kind of a way of putting people in sort of pigeonholes of different personality types based on these four different dimensions. So this is based on the idea, this psychological idea by Carl Jung, that perception and judgement are different in different people. We don't all see the world in the same way, and we don't all make decisions in the same way. So perception is defined as ways of becoming aware of things. So you might just think there's only one way of becoming aware of things. You you see it, right. You may be a very visual perceiver. There are different ways of perceiving actually. And different people see things in different ways. And judgement is how we come to decisions or conclusions based on what we've perceived. Some people base it on the hard facts, other people don't. Other people base it on feelings. Right? You may find that strange because you have a certain way of perceiving and judging. You might not realise that other people have different ways of perceiving and judging, and that's why I think this is a useful tool to be aware of. Just like before. There's no best type. Actually, you want as much diversity as possible in a team. So you can answer this through four questions. First of all, how do you get your energy? Think about yourself. Where do you get your energy from? Are you an extroverted person who gets their energy from people who feels energised by being around people? Or are you an introverted person who feels more energised when you're on your own working and you find it hard work and draining when you're in a group environment? There is no right or wrong answer. Just which are you? Are you or I? So just remember that letter. Second question. How do you see the world? Right. If you're a sensor. You use your five senses to see the world. You pay attention to detail. You focus on reality. Reality is important to you. If you are alternatively an intuitive, you have a sort of a sixth sense about the world. You can see the big picture. You focus on possibilities and you think in more abstract terms. So are you thinking on sort of concrete practical things, or are you more of an abstract theoretician and an intuitive? So are you an S or an N? So decide which one you are there. Question three are you a thinker or a feeler? Thinkers use their head to think they make decisions based on logic. They use the things they have sensed from the world to make decisions. They're interested in things they like, ideas. They think everyone should be treated the same. They think fairness is important. A feeler, on the other hand, tends to make decisions with their heart, if that makes sense to you. They make decisions based on their values. They're interested in people and emotions. So the goal is not, you know, fairness and equality, but it's actually compassion and treating people the way they need to be treated based on the situation. So are you a thinker or are you a feeler? Decide which side of that you're on. And finally, judging and perceiving judges are people who are very organised and structured in their in their thought process. They make plans. They keep to the plan. They like to be in control. Perceivers, on the other hand, are very casual and relaxed. They're the people who go with the flow. They can change and adapt quickly. In last week's seminar, the judges, I think, found it harder than the Perceivers. I think there is a big difference. Perhaps in all the previous weeks, the judges were doing a great job of making a good project brief. So which side are you on? Are you a judge or a perceiver? Okay, so you should have now four letters that describe you. So now answer the poll and tell me what your forward letters are. So if you can't decide which side you're on, some people might be in the middle. Just just pick one side. It doesn't really matter. It's kind of really a spectrum between the two. There's no you're not kind of binary in one category or the other sometimes. Or maybe you are. Okay. Is everyone put in their answers? I'll press stop now. Okay, so let's see who our class is made of. We have very few extroverts in the room. We have a room of introverted people. Very interesting. In fact, of those introverted people we have, what's the bottom row there?

SPEAKER 3
Roll eyes.

SPEAKER 0
That majority ends as well. So we're all introverted. Intuitive. We see the big picture. I'm very interesting. And we have some a bit of a balance between those who are. Thinkers versus feelers. And a mix of judges and perceivers in the room. So bear in mind where your box is on that grid. Hopefully you can find your box. There is. There is plenty of research that tries to figure out what kind of what kind of job prospects you have, for example. I'm not saying this is prescriptive and don't, you know, don't assume this, this is the case. But a lot of you are down here. So you're all kind of suitable to things like investment banker, computer programmer. That's pretty good that we had quite a few MPs in the room. That's very useful. But also we have people who could be good graphic designers or therapist, mental health counsellors. I don't I don't think we usually get many of those in the room. Let me just go back to the numbers. Wow. The majority of you are in the wrong degree. No, I don't I don't think that's true. We had quite a few estates as well. Things like accounting or web development would be suitable to you apparently. And I don't know how how true any of this stuff is, but I'd be very interested to hear your feedback at some point if you think it is true and it applies to you. The point of this is not to sort of predict your future or something like that. It's just to show that there are many different ways of seeing and acting in the world and being aware of these things. I think it's important because I think when I was sitting where you are now, I don't think I was aware of there were different ways of thinking. Our project managers up there. Do we have any ESG DJs in the room? Just go back. No, no project manager in the room. Well that's surprising. That's because they're all online. Maybe, I don't know. Okay. So that concludes today's lecture by me. But we have a great guest lecture coming up. Amanda Nash from Tyche is going to talk to us in a few minutes. So let us take is three minutes enough for a break? Anyone need more than three, you said, well, let's take a three minute break while we get Amanda set up. And then Amanda will tell us all about project management at scale.

UNKNOWN
Thank you. Nice to meet you. Are you coming?

SPEAKER 0
I can announce that if anyone dropped a hat. There is a hat over here.

UNKNOWN
I've got my.

SPEAKER 4
Lights on here for me just to run.

SPEAKER 0
Them for you, if that helps you.

UNKNOWN
Oh can I? I was hoping you put the table there. Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
I mean.

SPEAKER 5
If you get that microphone set up, if you've got a pocket or something, I can click on to. Okay. And then that just sort of clips on anyway. You okay. I think it's quite loud, so I just need to be close to your mouth. If not, I'll put your table just there.

SPEAKER 4
Okay. Most often. Okay. That's a good idea. In your pocket. Okay. Is this going to be too loud? Okay. Okay.

SPEAKER 5
I think you should balance yourself.

SPEAKER 4
All right. Hello? Does that work?

SPEAKER 5
It sounded like it was slightly echoes. Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Was going to.

SPEAKER 5
So I can control your slides with this.

SPEAKER 4
Okay.

SPEAKER 5
Then I can. There are lots of questions about. I got lots of questions. Okay. I might come back and answer some of these at the end. I'll archive those for now. I can do that with my phone. But they should be able to answer ask questions during this as well.

SPEAKER 4
Okay, cool. I've got like three tasks. Yeah, I know that. The first one. So my other two questions are going the same as well.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah yeah yeah. I just showed you that one. Yeah. They're all in there. Cool, cool. I can show you the slides if you want. Quick quick quick, just a second. So what I've got is the first question there. We'll ask them that one. Okay. Ten waterfall. And then this will show the results. And then this next question was that one. And in the last question there. This is just one individual testing individual.

SPEAKER 4
About those at the top. Maybe just hold. There will be no.

SPEAKER 5
And so there are people watching from home as well. It's kind of being streamed. 68. Yes. Okay. So I think.

SPEAKER 4
It stops at.

SPEAKER 5
This point. So a kind of a middle. Do you need anything else? If you have any. You need.

SPEAKER 4
Everything. Really?

SPEAKER 5
Scream again. That's what. Okay. I'll sit somewhere in the audience.

SPEAKER 4
Okay, cool, cool. You can just start when you're ready. Okay. Cool and thirsty. Thank you all to Ryan for inviting Turkey to speak in your guest lecture slot. My former departmental boss has presented this lecture in the past few years like no pressure, so I'm honoured to have been passed the baton and given the opportunity to share my industry experiences with you guys today. And so if we can move to the next slide, please. And just a little background before we begin. That's why. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. This one. Great. So my name is Amanda. I'm a senior project manager in a professional services consultancy called Teskey. I've worked in IT project management for five years, and I've project managers on both the client side and consultancy side. So prior to Teskey, I was working within the public sector in an NHS organisation. And for what it's worth, my Myers-Briggs is enfj. I'm an enabler, apparently. So yeah, that's a bit about me. So moving on. So for today's session. So today I've come in to shed some light on how project management theory effectively works in the real world. And I'm going to talk to you guys through how project methodologies work in practice. I'll take you through a real life case study of a project I worked on a couple of years ago, and I'll then go over the challenges of managing at scale what they are in practice, and that should leave enough time for some questions at the end of the session. So I know that the project management module has taken you guys through the theory of prints to waterfall agile and associated agile approaches such as Lean and Kanban. And I'm also sure you've been told that essentially agile is really awesome. And waterfall somewhat isn't so great. It's dated, it's inflexible. No one like really cares about it anymore. But in practice, pure agile is not always the best approach. And a couple of years ago I went on a course which is called The Prince to Agile, and it essentially promotes the idea of taking the best out of Prince to and the best out of agile to create essentially the most effective rated project manager in IT project. And so this brings me on to my first mini task for today, which is I've listed six characteristics of projects and taking into account what you guys have learnt about Agile and Waterfall already. I'd like you to group these into Camp agile, Camp waterfall or both. So I understand you've got a voting mechanism. So the next slide will be to vote for which of these six characteristics you think are agile. And then the second slide will be the same characteristics for waterfall and then which you think are both. So I'll give you guys a minute to put your sponsors in for agile and then. You can move to the next slide. No. 10s. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Great. Cool and I'll move on to I'll move on to the next slide and then I'll go over the go over the answers. Yeah. Is that the boat? Has the both side been done as well? Oh, right. Sorry. Okay, cool. So yeah just having a look at the answers. So and yes. So for agile of those six characteristics we've got rich communication daily daily standups and the existence of the definition done. And I can see that loads of people thought that no one picked that one at all. Okay. So yes. So the existence of the definition of done in agile, this is an agreement between the project team on the set of conditions. That must be true in order to consider backlog items like fully completed. So that's something within within agile methodology for waterfall. It's managed by exception and structured project governance. And so I can see from the poll that yeah that yeah I think you guys have got that right. So yeah that's yeah. Pretty self-explanatory with regards to managing risks as they come up and having like a really structured process in place for reporting on project progress, etcetera. And, and then for both it's ensuring quality of project of project product I think is that any one person I think has voted for that. So yes, this is a well, yeah. It's really important to remember that neither project methodology is worse at ensuring the product quality. So yeah, I just wanted to make that as a point. So yeah. Thank you. Next slide please. Say, and I will now take you through a real project that I worked on as part of the current program I work on with A.C.. And so this is something that cropped up a couple of years ago for myself. And the client is a high profile government transport infrastructure organisation. And following a ministerial review, the organisation has been given a mandate to provide a client facing portal within six months that allows claimants to that are affected by the land acquisition process to to view the status of their claims. This this portal will expose relevant details to claimants from the organisation's existing client relationship management system CRM system. So as the solutions are going to be public facing, the build would be subject to really intense scrutiny. And there's also going to be added project activities beyond a core technical delivery that include participation and extra assessments to ensure that the build meets basic accessibility standards. And at this point in time, my comment project is managing the delivery of enhancements to the existing CRM system. So my program manager tells me that this new portal project and associated requirements will be added into scope for the next, next tranche of agreed project work. So this means that my my project team is going to increase from seven people to 12. So with that in mind, this brings me to my next task. And so, taking this scenario into account, I'd like you to think about what project characteristics from Agile and Waterfall are used to approach the project delivery. And so if we just go through each. Yeah, each one of these. Yeah. So we've got agile project product backlog refinement and agile use of Kanban for build task management. Waterfall prints two stage boundary management and the agile approach to change which is embracing change and making making associated adjustments. So I'll just give you guys a moment to.

UNKNOWN
To vote. Thank you.

SPEAKER 4
Oh. Can't see.

SPEAKER 5
Six people in the middle, too. Cool. Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Okay, cool. So I'll just go through each one. So the first the first characteristic product backlog refinement that was false scope was in fact defined at the very start of the project, which is something waterfall. And for the second one, using Kanban for build task management. That was true. We use a Microsoft task tool called DevOps, and it enables and enables task management through a Kanban board. So yeah, we found that extremely valuable as part of the delivery process. And the next one was Prince to stage boundary management. Yeah, we absolutely adhered to this. So we did stage boundary reports and to to the project board. So they would review those at the end of each project stage and give the go ahead to move into the next stage of the project. And then finally agile approach to change. So this is something we didn't do as part of the project approach. And change was managed via really strict change control, just to ensure that project timeframes and budget were adhered to. So yeah, thank you for that. So. Continuing on. So going on to leadership challenges of managing at scale. And so a friend and mentor of mine has pointed me to something I have found extremely valuable with respect to managing large project projects. And that's John Adair's model called Action Centred Leadership. So the action centred leadership model was first introduced in 1973 by leadership theorist John Adair, and essentially it highlights the core actions that you must take to lead your team effectively, rather than thinking about the leadership styles that you choose. So with this model, he's grouped actions into three areas. So those are tasks which are what actions you take to achieve your goal a team. So these are actions at group level, the type of actions that you encourage effective teamwork with and group cohesion and then finally individual. So these are actions that address each team members unique needs. And the model is about understanding how the aforementioned three areas rely on each other's success. And it demonstrates how effective leadership on large scale projects is achieved when you're able to balance your actions across all three areas. So in light of the like the short case study that we've just gone through, I'm going to describe a real scenario that I encountered on the project, and I want you to think about what area of Adair's model I needed to focus on to mitigate the task. So if you look at the bottom corner. So here's a scenario which is upon commence and the project described in my case study, it was apparent that my team overall works together. But one of my developers is falling behind schedule. So this is a risk where the impact is that the decline in productivity will cause the design deadline to be missed, and projects milestones will need to be pushed out as a result. This will make the client very unhappy. So my question is of the three areas represented in today's module, which do you think will be the most relevant to focus on at this point from a leadership perspective? Let's give you a moment to think about your answer.

UNKNOWN
Beautiful. That's the. Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Okay, so I think. Yeah. So yeah that that the majority are correct. It is individual. The reason for this is if I prioritise, for example, task at the expense of focusing on the team and individual actions. This is going to present issues for those neglected areas if they're not addressed properly. So examples of individual tasks that I need to consider with respect to the scenario would be things such as ensuring that there's sufficient training and within the appropriate skills that the developer needs to be able to complete his designs, offering him or her constructive feedback and and also just providing, just being on point to remember to provide support and encouragement to that person. And. So yeah, that that's that's the final scenario we've got. There's also like a bunch of other examples of tasks that focus on like the individual. So there'll be things such as like establishing previous experience and seeking seek out and seeking out and using individual's abilities, making sure that they're yeah, that they're being thought about and represented properly within the project. And just examples of other of the other two areas. So for task functions, you'd have things such as briefing the team members on the task and what their role is in the project, ensuring that the team remain focussed on the plan, evaluating progress and modifying the plan accordingly. And then for team functions, examples of things such as buildings, team spirit, maintaining morale within the team and just dealing constructively to resolve conflicts. So yeah, so this brings me to the end of my my lecture, and I really hope that you found this insightful. And thank you so much for listening. And I'm now opening the floor to any questions. Thank you.

UNKNOWN
Hi. It is much.

SPEAKER 4
I'm so sorry. Could you repeat your question?

SPEAKER 6
Get another experience.

UNKNOWN
Like doing the work of the project looking for. For example.

SPEAKER 4
I think learning on the job is really is really effective in terms of being able to like, learn how to manage like the softer side of project management with regards to maintaining like a team balance in terms of having to deal with like difficult conversations and things. A lot of my job is about like managing risks and issues, being really quick to respond to things to the client and having difficult conversations with them about the budget. There may be situations where I have to talk about, you know, you know, budgets and it may need to be extended for various reasons. And through experience. I find it it just yeah, you just become a bit more fluid with being able to handle those situations and that. Yeah, it's very much I felt like I was when I started my career in project management, I used to be an accountant before, and I was kind of dipped in the deep end. And I think that was pretty helpful just to like learning on the job and and just, yeah, enabling me to now deliver a much more senior level. Hi.

SPEAKER 5
What are some of the pitfalls that you see in large scale public projects about economics.

SPEAKER 4
And how to use all? So I think the larger the team are, there's a lot more there's a lot more challenge with having to deal with like, like different personalities within your individual project team. And I had to do a lot of work with like setting, setting the scene and being very clear about everyone's roles and responsibilities and also like making sure everyone was clear about what part of their role played in the puzzle of delivering a solution. And I did, yeah, we had a really focussed initial workshops to just get the team to think about collectively how how we would like, do, like ways of working, how we would utilise Microsoft DevOps to, which is like a really useful task management system. Like you can you can basically amend it in ways to identify like status positions with different task items and figuring out like, like the flow of how you'd get from A to 80 B with respect to like an item being delivered within the project. And it's a lot more intricate than having to deal with like a small project because you have like a smaller budget, you're the scrutiny isn't as high with large projects. I mean, yeah, it's given the like this portal project I had, it was like suddenly like a lot more governance like, and all eyes are on you to make sure that you don't overspend and, and that you're delivering value for money and you're having to have much higher level conversations with senior stakeholders who are placing, like, a lot of interest in what you're delivering. So you have to be really on the ball with respect to your like, with respect to like your your general governance and making sure that your plan, like you know exactly where you are on your plan. You know what every member of your team is doing. But at the same time, you're also having to deal with the fact you don't have the time to then, you know, individually see what every member of your team is doing. So then it's also about like delegating elements to other like sub team leads. So we'd have like a lead, like a lead, like a technical architected essentially support with managing the devs at a much lower level with respect to the like, the detailed tasks they're doing. And we'd have like a test manager who support the test team accordingly. So it's about like, yeah, you're kind of building like a mini like like a, almost like a little company within the company, sort of. But yeah, that that's been like a, like a challenge that I've been very aware of since working at. Yeah. On much, much larger projects.

SPEAKER 5
I thank you. And so you talked about Prince to Azure. It seems like you. That approach. Interested to know how much documentation is required in Prince to Azure.

SPEAKER 4
They talk about like they talk about being able to to flex that with respect to the needs of the project. So it's about what I found really useful from it versus doing. So before that I was just prints to like practitioner qualified and it just delivers an element of it. It enables you to deliver so much more flexibility with being able to take the best out of both types of methodology, because you're able to maintain control through using prints to elements of prints to governance. But they make you think about how to tailor that, tailor that more effectively rather than just doing like a just just being, you know, just very bog standard, applying the same formula to every single project you do. You're I feel like I'm a much more effective it as a result of, of just understanding that. And they talk about something called the agile Ometer, which brings into Lake, which makes you think about the fact that how how ready is a client to be fully agile. And it's it's interesting because those are people want to be agile and in projects because it it sounds faster and it sounds more modern, and it sounds like you're just going to get everything done for cheaper and quicker. But there's a lot of work from the client side involved with. Making that happen and just understanding the level of like participation and decision making that end users will need to be doing as part of the project when they've also got business as usual stuff to get on with. I think the benefit of Prince to Agile is that you can kind of bring in elements of agile without without having to force them to go full throttle with committing entirely because they just don't have the capacity to, to support, to support full agile. So, yeah. Yes, I forgot what the question was, but yeah, I think. Yeah. Hi. You mentioned that you. Yeah. Oh, that's a really good question. And I think I'm thinking about some of my, my technical architect who's he's been doing his well for quite a while and he's really. Yeah. He's come from a computing background and he's I just think that you, you kind of learn to give the like just relevant information that highlights okay, this is a risk and issue. But this is the impact of what I'm saying. This is this is what's going to happen down the line from me raising I know from from this issue that I'm raising and it's, it's something that you kind of like learn as, as you kind of become more experienced. But yeah, just like tailoring your communication in a way that is that is understandable to other people who aren't in the thick of it. And that's also something from my perspective, I've had to deal with, because I have to deliver them that information at an even higher level to senior stakeholders. So I think, yeah, that's something that I think as a skill is really effective to, to like work well with. Yeah. If you're like from the tech side of things and you're like working with your project manager because I work very closely with my, my tech people and I make sure that they want to make sure they have everything they need to do their jobs and that they're not blocked on the things that they're working on. So we can deliver things on time. So yeah, that's probably quite important from my perspective. Hey. So I'm really sorry. I can't hear you very well. I'm sorry. These words are about the definition of done. So is your question about like what is that? How is that defined or. On. Oh I see. So I think with respect to agile, there's an element of when it's about from a build perspective, when you've delivered that code, like what, when, when is it finished? So it's ready to move on to the next stage of testing, because the level of communication and agile between with your internal team is of such so much more intense versus waterfall, because you're you're having to communicate as soon as something as soon as you've done something, you should just pass it along, and then someone's going to be testing it and then their feedback saying like, nope, this has got a bug, let's bring it back. Either need to fix it and that. So it's a definition with respect to like that level, that task level are supposed to like yeah. Like we've got this project and here's the scope and we know you need this this and this functionality to to yeah. To go live. It's just it's like a more like lower level defining what that what done is. Hey.

SPEAKER 6
Using predominantly Microsoft.

UNKNOWN
Technologies. What do you.

SPEAKER 4
So before I came to ski, I, I was shopping around, so I was on the client side. We were trying to procure. We were looking at different systems to pick. We were procuring a finance system to replace like a 20 year old like now. Not like no longer like it's not like no one sells open accounts. It doesn't exist anymore. So if we were looking at like Oracle, like sage, and then like the big hitters with respect to finance systems and Microsoft as well. And. I. I mean, I've worked in Microsoft now for, for so long that I'm just used to like how, like things flow within the system, but it's really like it's really subjective to what your company needs in terms of reporting. I think it's not I don't know, I wouldn't say it was constructive from from that point of view, I think. It mean all these different systems essentially have a similar output, but it's just it's just executed in a in a different way, and the look will be different. But essentially the functions are all quite similar. So I think it was boils down to what the client wants to spend. I mean, yeah, I think it depends on how expensive it is. I think that kind of always becomes the main decision factor. But I will say that Microsoft stuff always looks quite clean and. Having worked on other finance systems I've found relatively janky. But yeah, but that's obviously I'll be a bit biased because I work in it every day.

SPEAKER 5
And there was a question from someone. Yeah. So how do you decide?

SPEAKER 4
So it's on a case by case basis. This is where I think experience really lends itself to. Like you just become like a you just become a like a better project manager, like the more you do, I suppose. But it's really like looking at, I guess, thinking about the examples of like those actions that I laid out with within those three areas. And then I think it's kind of having like a sense of like, almost like you need to be quite intuitive to, to figure out, okay, this is. Okay. This is something. This is something that's going wrong because I'm not paying enough because like, the morale is really low. So. And then I need to focus on on team actions for example all. It could be something to do with task because okay, like the the deadlines are actually looming. I don't think that this is going to get done on time, but that's maybe a feeling on my part where I had to review like the estimates more closely and actually allowed more time to enable completion within and set those expectations to the client at the beginning. So it's really yeah, it's it's a you kind of have to like apply a lot of like. I don't know, like like. Yeah. Just you have to be quite intuitive and like, just think, like thinking about the thing. Because when I'm doing my job, I'm not thinking like, okay, I'm going to think about a dead theory and then like, think about how I'm going to deal with this situation. You kind of it just becomes a lot more like second nature that you're just like, right, this is what I need to do to to solve this issue or risk. And, and I think the model actually really neatly summarises what I think today. But yeah, but it just it's just essentially put what, what like senior project managers do like but he's just like made it very succinct within within this model. And so. Yeah. Hope so. Hope that was helpful. Response.

UNKNOWN
Really? Well, I can barely wrap it there.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, sure. The final question. Do you have any advice? If anybody group wants to become a project manager, what's the best?

SPEAKER 7
Have to get into that.

SPEAKER 4
And to be honest, I didn't have I didn't. My journey into project management was a kind of like a happy, slightly happy coincidence. But I think with regard to going going into it, there's a I know that a lot of my colleagues have like joined graduate schemes and they do offer those. Opportunities where you start like you do, you'll have projects to start managing within, like the scheme that they're setting out for the next for the first couple of years that you're working there. I know that's something that colleagues and friends of mine have. Started their journey through and but some of my other friends have ended up doing project management, but they've actually done other careers before that. Like myself included, I, I literally just qualified, like qualified as, like an accountant. And I decided to like, switch things up a bit because I didn't want to work in finance anymore. But it's still like utilises elements that I like about finance with regards to like, you know, managing budgets really closely. So we're getting like a really big project. It's like, yeah, I can like build like really good trackers and like, like like analyse my numbers like really effectively and stuff. And I do enjoy that side of things. So, so yeah, it's it's kind of yeah, I don't know. It's very much like I think grad scheme opportunities are a good way if you're certain that you want to go into it after uni, but otherwise I think. But I don't know if it's. People's careers is kind of end up in ways that you wouldn't have thought about five years before. So I don't think maybe careers people are more happy. Happy for me to say this, but I think that your journey I had I really didn't know what, that I'd be here like five years ago. So.

SPEAKER 8
Yeah.

SPEAKER 4
Opportunities are open for you to do sort of like. Do whatever you. Whatever you want, really, I think. Yeah, I know, so like if you go into something and it's not something like you love quite as much, you've given it a go, you've given it, you've given it a chance. It's it's never too late to to like, have a think and like challenge yourself in a different way. It's totally fine because I was quite scared about that when I came out of uni, and I thought I'd made a decision with finance, and then I realised that actually there's other things out that you can do, and that's how I ended up doing project management. So and it's something I'm like, I'm so much happier in my career right now than I was before, but some of my other friends have stayed in finance and they absolutely love it. So. Yeah. Just like listen, like listen to yourself. And also just remember that, like. You will spend most of your time working it, and it needs to be something that gives you a sense of satisfaction. How what that means to you is entirely individual. So that's like my piece of advice.

UNKNOWN
Thanks very much. Thank you.

SPEAKER 5
Do a few Q&A about the exam. I had. Thank you. Okay, so a few questions. So can you hear me?

SPEAKER 9
Is it on?

SPEAKER 5
Okay. So.

UNKNOWN
Does the essay.

SPEAKER 5
The last two chapters only. The final solution for.

SPEAKER 0
Chapters, you modify chapters one and two, although we're on now. Sorry, does the essay include all four chapters? Yes it does. It should include all four chapters. You can modify chapters one and two before the final submission. Does it make sense to have everyone in the group talk in the presentation? I don't think it makes sense to have everybody talk. I think it'll be a bit too chaotic if your group's got 6 or 7 people in especially, it would be mayhem to try and get all of that in five minutes. 1 or 2 people, as far as I'm concerned, is plenty. Now. You may have heard other otherwise from your from the tutors in your group, but I personally would suggest 1 or 2 and I'll make sure that they're aware that I've said that as well, so that they don't penalise you for for not all speaking. The point is that you're all going to contribute to the presentation, but some people are better at speaking than others, and you need to work to your team's strengths. If you're better at doing something else for the team, you should work. Focus on that. Does the interim mark on Moodle impact the final results? No, it does not. Unless you fail to submit your essay or fail to properly engage with the peer assessment, in which case penalties will apply to your final mark. But the mark you got on Moodle does not impact the final results. Should we memorise the 20 cognitive biases? No, you don't need to memorise the 20 cognitive biases. Next week I'll talk all about what you need to memorise and what you don't need to memorise and exam related stuff. Let me. Also mention that next week I'd like you to decide what we learn about. I want to tailor that final lecture to suit your your things. Now, there are a few things that we didn't manage to cover during during the lecture series that I will go over, but there'll be plenty of time for us to also tailor that lecture to what you want to to do. So please visit that link and I think it should be set up. If it's not set up, I'll set it up almost straight after this lecture so that you can fill in your responses for next week. So hopefully that's doable. In fact, I'll do that now. So it's set up. In fact. Yeah, it's five two now, so you're welcome to leave. And I'll make this make sure this is set up for you to give us your answers for next time. Thanks everyone. And thanks again to Amanda for a great guest lecture. Jess.
