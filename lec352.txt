In project management, the Iron Triangle, or "Project Management Triangle," consists of three key constraints: Scope, Time, and Cost. These constraints form the boundaries of any project, and managing them effectively is a key skill for any project manager. The challenge of the Iron Triangle is that you typically cannot optimize all three aspects simultaneously. If you wish to expand the Scope of a project, for instance, either Time or Cost must increase. Similarly, reducing the Time allocated to a project will likely increase Cost or reduce the projectâ€™s Scope.

One of the main ideas in project management is to find a balance or trade-off between these constraints, depending on the specific needs and priorities of a project. For example, in some cases, meeting the deadline (Time) is the most important goal, meaning you might need to adjust the Scope or accept higher Costs to ensure on-time delivery. On the other hand, a project with a fixed budget will require careful management of the Scope and Time to ensure everything fits within the financial constraints.

Some more flexible project methodologies also introduce additional factors, such as Quality or Risk, into this triangle, extending it beyond the traditional three elements. However, the fundamental balancing act remains the same: Scope, Time, and Cost must all be managed carefully, and sacrifices in one area will likely affect the others.
